1. ***Startup Aims for Full Automation:   <br>Tamay Besiroglu's startup, Mechanize, seeks to automate all work using AI agents, causing controversy and attracting investment. The goal is full automation of all work and economy and replacing human workers in all sectors. While the AI can promote economic growth, the critics are concerned about job losses, the AI models still have limitations.***  <br>  <br>
   Apr 19, TechCrunch published an [article](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/19/famed-ai-researcher-launches-controversial-startup-to-replace-all-human-workers-everywhere/) “Famed AI researcher launches controversial startup to replace all human workers everywhere”. Tamay Besiroglu, a prominent AI researcher, has launched Mechanize, a startup with the ambitious goal of fully automating all work and the economy. This announcement has stirred controversy, with critics arguing it damages the reputation of his respected research institute, Epoch. Mechanize aims to replace human workers with AI agents, initially targeting white-collar jobs. Besiroglu argues that this could lead to explosive economic growth and higher living standards, though critics are concerned about job loss and income inequality. He calculates the market potential to be enormous, with global wages totaling around $60 trillion annually. Despite the backlash, Mechanize has attracted significant investment from notable figures in the tech industry. Besiroglu acknowledges the current limitations of AI agents, such as reliability and task execution, but believes that overcoming these challenges will lead to economic abundance. He also suggests that even in an AI-dominated economy, human wages could increase due to complementary roles that AI cannot perform. Mechanize is actively hiring, indicating its commitment to advancing this vision despite the controversy.  <br>  <br>

3. ***New Dataset and Multi-Agent System for RAG:   <br>A new paper introduces RAMDocs, a dataset for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with conflicting evidence, and MADAM-RAG, a multi-agent system that uses LLMs to debate answers and discard misinformation. The existing RAG models performed poorly in RAMDocs and there still exist significant gaps for the current models to solve.***  <br>  <br>
   Apr 17, Uni of North Carolina at Chapel Hill published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13079) “Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Conflicting Evidence”. Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve the factuality of their responses. However, in practice, these systems often need to handle ambiguous user queries and potentially conflicting information from multiple sources while also suppressing inaccurate information from noisy or irrelevant documents. Prior work has generally studied and addressed these challenges in isolation, considering only one aspect at a time, such as handling ambiguity or robustness to noise and misinformation. The authors instead consider multiple factors simultaneously, proposing (i) RAMDocs (Retrieval with Ambiguity and Misinformation in Documents), a new dataset that simulates complex and realistic scenarios for conflicting evidence for a user query, including ambiguity, misinformation, and noise; and (ii) MADAM-RAG, a multi-agent approach in which LLM agents debate over the merits of an answer over multiple rounds, allowing an aggregator to collate responses corresponding to disambiguated entities while discarding misinformation and noise, thereby handling diverse sources of conflict jointly. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of MADAM-RAG using both closed and open-source models on AmbigDocs -- which requires presenting all valid answers for ambiguous queries -- improving over strong RAG baselines by up to 11.40% and on FaithEval -- which requires suppressing misinformation -- where to improve by up to 15.80% (absolute) with Llama3.3-70B-Instruct. Furthermore, the study finds that RAMDocs poses a challenge for existing RAG baselines (Llama3.3-70B-Instruct only obtains 32.60 exact match score). While MADAM-RAG begins to address these conflicting factors, the analysis indicates that a substantial gap remains especially when increasing the level of imbalance in supporting evidence and misinformation.  <br>  <br>

5. ***Attentional Bias as Foundation for Neural Architectures:   <br>Google's paper reinterprets neural architectures as associative memory modules that use attentional bias, exploring alternative attentional bias configurations and retention regularization techniques. It then presents Miras, a general framework to design deep learning architectures based on four choices. Experiments show different design choices in Miras yield models with varying strengths for language modeling, commonsense reasoning, and recall intensive tasks***  <br>  <br>
   Apr 17, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13173) “It's All Connected: A Journey Through Test-Time Memorization, Attentional Bias, Retention, and Online Optimization”. Designing efficient and effective architectural backbones has been in the core of research efforts to enhance the capability of foundation models. Inspired by the human cognitive phenomenon of attentional bias-the natural tendency to prioritize certain events or stimuli-we reconceptualize neural architectures, including Transformers, Titans, and modern linear recurrent neural networks as associative memory modules that learn a mapping of keys and values using an internal objective, referred to as attentional bias. Surprisingly, the study observed that most existing sequence models leverage either (1) dot-product similarity, or (2) L2 regression objectives as their attentional bias. Going beyond these objectives, the study presents a set of alternative attentional bias configurations along with their effective approximations to stabilize their training procedure. The authers then reinterpret forgetting mechanisms in modern deep learning architectures as a form of retention regularization, providing a novel set of forget gates for sequence models. Building upon these insights, the study present Miras, a general framework to design deep learning architectures based on four choices of: (i) associative memory architecture, (ii) attentional bias objective, (iii) retention gate, and (iv) memory learning algorithm. The work presents three novel sequence models-Moneta, Yaad, and Memora-that go beyond the power of existing linear RNNs while maintaining a fast parallelizable training process. Experiments show different design choices in Miras yield models with varying strengths. For example, certain instances of Miras achieve exceptional performance in special tasks such as language modeling, commonsense reasoning, and recall intensive tasks, even outperforming Transformers and other modern linear recurrent models.  <br>  <br>

7. ***Offline "Thinking" Reduces Test-Time Compute:   <br>A recent study introduces "sleep-time compute," which allows models to pre-compute useful quantities offline to reduce computation requirements at test-time. It can reduce the amount of test-time compute needed to achieve the same accuracy by ~ 5x and that by scaling sleep-time compute the study can further increase accuracy by up to 13% on Stateful GSM-Symbolic and 18% on Stateful AIME. It also conducts additional analysis to understand when sleep-time compute is most effective***  <br>  <br>
   Apr 17, Letta and UC Berkeley published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13171) “Sleep-time Compute: Beyond Inference Scaling at Test-time”. Scaling test-time compute has emerged as a key ingredient for enabling large language models (LLMs) to solve difficult problems, but comes with high latency and inference cost. The study introduces sleep-time compute, which allows models to "think" offline about contexts before queries are presented: by anticipating what queries users might ask and pre-computing useful quantities, the study can significantly reduce the compute requirements at test-time. To demonstrate the efficacy of the method, the work creates modified versions of two reasoning tasks - Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME. The study finds that sleep-time compute can reduce the amount of test-time compute needed to achieve the same accuracy by ~ 5x on Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME and that by scaling sleep-time compute the study can further increase accuracy by up to 13% on Stateful GSM-Symbolic and 18% on Stateful AIME. Furthermore, the work introduces Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic, which extends GSM-Symbolic by including multiple related queries per context. By amortizing sleep-time compute across related queries about the same context using Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic, the study can decrease the average cost per query by 2.5x. The work then conducts additional analysis to understand when sleep-time compute is most effective, finding the predictability of the user query to be well correlated with the efficacy of sleep-time compute. Finally, the study conducts a case-study of applying sleep-time compute to a realistic agentic SWE task. https://github.com/letta-ai/sleep-time-compute

9. ***Models for Detecting AI-Generated Content: Traversaal.ai et al. published a paper that introduces a new set of models built for the task of token classification which are trained on an extensive collection of human-machine co-authored texts, which performed well over texts of unseen domains, unseen generators, texts by non-native speakers and those with adversarial inputs. The work also introduces a new dataset of over 2.4M such texts mostly co-authored by several popular proprietary LLMs over 23 languages***
    Apr 16, Traversaal.ai, Vantager, Cohere, et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11952) “Robust and Fine-Grained Detection of AI Generated Texts”. An ideal detection system for machine generated content is supposed to work well on any generator as many more advanced LLMs come into existence day by day. Existing systems often struggle with accurately identifying AI-generated content over shorter texts. Further, not all texts might be entirely authored by a human or LLM, hence the study focused more over partial cases i.e human-LLM co-authored texts. The paper introduces a set of models built for the task of token classification which are trained on an extensive collection of human-machine co-authored texts, which performed well over texts of unseen domains, unseen generators, texts by non-native speakers and those with adversarial inputs. The work also introduces a new dataset of over 2.4M such texts mostly co-authored by several popular proprietary LLMs over 23 languages. The study also presents findings of the models' performance over each texts of each domain and generator. Additional findings include comparison of performance against each adversarial method, length of input texts and characteristics of generated texts compared to the original human authored texts.

11. ***Reinforcement Learning for Diffusion LLM Reasoning:   <br>UCLA and Meta's paper proposes d1, a framework that adapts pre-trained masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) into reasoning models using supervised finetuning and a novel critic-free, policy-gradient based RL algorithm called diffu-GRPO. The work finds that d1 yields the best performance and significantly improves performance of a state-of-the-art dLLM.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 16, UCLA and Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12216) “d1: Scaling Reasoning in Diffusion Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning”. Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities that benefits from online reinforcement learning (RL). These capabilities have primarily been demonstrated within the left-to-right autoregressive (AR) generation paradigm. In contrast, non-autoregressive paradigms based on diffusion generate text in a coarse-to-fine manner. Although recent diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have achieved competitive language modeling performance compared to their AR counterparts, it remains unclear if dLLMs can also leverage recent advances in LLM reasoning. To this end, the study proposes d1, a framework to adapt pre-trained masked dLLMs into reasoning models via a combination of supervised finetuning (SFT) and RL. Specifically, the work develops and extends techniques to improve reasoning in pretrained dLLMs: (a) utilizing a masked SFT technique to distill knowledge and instill self-improvement behavior directly from existing datasets, and (b) introducing a novel critic-free, policy-gradient based RL algorithm called diffu-GRPO. Through empirical studies, the study investigates the performance of different post-training recipes on multiple mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks. The study finds that d1 yields the best performance and significantly improves performance of a state-of-the-art dLLM. https://dllm-reasoning.github.io/  <br>  <br>

13. ***Analysis of LLM Reasoning Capabilities After SFT:   <br>UC Berkeley and Allen Inst for AI released a paper which analyses model performance on the AIME24 dataset to understand how reasoning capabilities evolve. It discovers a ladder-like structure in problem difficulty, and progresses from Easy to Medium tier requires adopting an R1 reasoning style with minimal SFT, while Hard-level questions suffer from frequent model's errors at each step of the reasoning chain.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 16, UC Berkeley and Allen Inst for AI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11741) “Climbing the Ladder of Reasoning: What LLMs Can-and Still Can't-Solve after SFT?”. Recent supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches have significantly improved language models' performance on mathematical reasoning tasks, even when models are trained at a small scale. However, the specific capabilities enhanced through such fine-tuning remain poorly understood. This study conducts a detailed analysis of model performance on the AIME24 dataset to understand how reasoning capabilities evolve. The study discovers a ladder-like structure in problem difficulty, categorize questions into four tiers (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Extremely Hard (Exh)), and identify the specific requirements for advancing between tiers. The work finds that progression from Easy to Medium tier requires adopting an R1 reasoning style with minimal SFT (500-1K instances), while Hard-level questions suffer from frequent model's errors at each step of the reasoning chain, with accuracy plateauing at around 65% despite logarithmic scaling. Exh-level questions present a fundamentally different challenge; they require unconventional problem-solving skills that current models uniformly struggle with. Additional findings reveal that carefully curated small-scale datasets offer limited advantage-scaling dataset size proves far more effective. The analysis provides a clearer roadmap for advancing language model capabilities in mathematical reasoning. https://github.com/sunblaze-ucb/reasoning_ladder.git  <br>  <br>

15. ***OpenAI Releases Models with Reasoning and Tool Capabilities:   <br>OpenAI has released o3 and o4-mini, combining reasoning with tools like web browsing and Python, excelling in complex tasks. The o-series models are trained with large-scale reinforcement learning on chains of thought and can reason about the safety policies in context when responding to potentially unsafe prompts***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 16, OpenAI released o3 and o4-mini and published a [report](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/2221c875-02dc-4789-800b-e7758f3722c1/o3-and-o4-mini-system-card.pdf) “OpenAI o3 and o4-mini System Card”. OpenAI o3 and OpenAI o4-mini combine state-of-the-art reasoning with full tool capabilities—web browsing, Python, image and file analysis, image generation, canvas, automations, file search, and memory. These models excel at solving complex math, coding, and scientific challenges while demonstrating strong visual perception and analysis. The models use tools in their chains of thought to augment their capabilities; for example, cropping or transforming images, searching the web, or using Python to analyze data during their thought process. The OpenAI o-series models are trained with large-scale reinforcement learning on chains of thought. These advanced reasoning capabilities provide new avenues for improving the safety and robustness of the models. In particular, the models can reason about the safety policies in context when responding to potentially unsafe prompts, through deliberative alignment. This is the first launch and system card to be released under Version 2 of the Preparedness Framework⁠. OpenAI’s Safety Advisory Group (SAG) reviewed the results of the Preparedness evaluations and determined that OpenAI o3 and o4-mini do not reach the High threshold in any of the three Tracked Categories: Biological and Chemical Capability, Cybersecurity, and AI Self-improvement. The report describes these evaluations, and provide an update on the work to mitigate risks in these areas.  <br>  <br>

17. ***Most-Cited Papers Focus on Research Tools and Methods:   <br>A Nature analysis reveals that the most-cited papers of the 21st century describe fundamental methods and tools, rather than major scientific breakthroughs. Papers providing widely applicable tools and frameworks for conducting research often accrue more citations than those presenting singular discoveries***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 15, Nature published an [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01125-9) “the most-cited papers of the twenty-first century”. Based on Nature's analysis across five databases, the most-cited scientific papers published since the year 2000 are typically not those detailing major scientific breakthroughs like the Higgs boson or CRISPR. Instead, the list is dominated by papers describing fundamental methods, research software, statistical techniques, databases, and standards for improving research quality. These works act as essential "workhorses" that underpin studies across numerous disciplines. The top paper is a 2016 report on Microsoft's deep residual learning networks (ResNets), crucial for modern AI advancements. Other highly cited examples include foundational AI techniques, software for data analysis, global cancer statistics reports, diagnostic manuals like the DSM-5, and guidelines for conducting systematic reviews (PRISMA). This trend highlights that papers providing widely applicable tools and frameworks for conducting research often accrue more citations than those presenting singular discoveries, reflecting their pervasive influence on the scientific process itself. Citation counts can vary between databases and are influenced by factors like the age of the paper and field size.  <br>  <br>

19. ***Rethinking Language Model Training with Future Goals:   <br>CMU's paper argues that rearranging and processing the training data sequences can allow models to more accurately imitate the true data-generating process, and does not require any other changes to the architecture or training infrastructure. It demonstrates that this technique, Trelawney, and the inference algorithms derived from it allow to improve performance on several key benchmarks***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 15, CMU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11336) “Looking beyond the next token”. The structure of causal language model training assumes that each token can be accurately predicted from the previous context. This contrasts with humans' natural writing and reasoning process, where goals are typically known before the exact argument or phrasings. While this mismatch has been well studied in the literature, the working assumption has been that architectural changes are needed to address this mismatch. The study argues that rearranging and processing the training data sequences can allow models to more accurately imitate the true data-generating process, and does not require any other changes to the architecture or training infrastructure. The work demonstrates that this technique, Trelawney, and the inference algorithms derived from it allow to improve performance on several key benchmarks that span planning, algorithmic reasoning, and story generation tasks. Finally, the method naturally enables the generation of long-term goals at no additional cost. The study investigates how using the model's goal-generation capability can further improve planning and reasoning. Additionally, the authors believe Trelawney could potentially open doors to new capabilities beyond the current language modeling paradigm.  <br>  <br>

21. ***Predicting Best Pretraining Data with Small-Scale Experiments:   <br>Allen Inst for AI et al. introduce DataDecide, a suite of models and data for predicting the best pretraining data using smaller experiments. The work finds that the ranking of models at a single, small size (e.g., 150M parameters) is a strong baseline for predicting best models at larger target scale (1B) and that using continuous likelihood metrics as proxies in small experiments makes benchmarks including MMLU, ARC, HellaSwag, MBPP, and HumanEval >80% predictable at the target 1B scale with just 0.01% of the compute.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 15, Allen Inst for AI, Uni of Washington and Uni of Penn published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11393) “DataDecide: How to Predict Best Pretraining Data with Small Experiments”. Because large language models are expensive to pretrain on different datasets, using smaller-scale experiments to decide on data is crucial for reducing costs. Which benchmarks and methods of making decisions from observed performance at small scale most accurately predict the datasets that yield the best large models? To empower open exploration of this question, the study releases models, data, and evaluations in DataDecide -- the most extensive open suite of models over differences in data and scale. The study conducts controlled pretraining experiments across 25 corpora with differing sources, deduplication, and filtering up to 100B tokens, model sizes up to 1B parameters, and 3 random seeds. The work finds that the ranking of models at a single, small size (e.g., 150M parameters) is a strong baseline for predicting best models at larger target scale (1B) (~80% of com parisons correct). No scaling law methods among 8 baselines exceed the compute-decision frontier of single-scale predictions, but DataDecide can measure improvement in future scaling laws. The study also identifies that using continuous likelihood metrics as proxies in small experiments makes benchmarks including MMLU, ARC, HellaSwag, MBPP, and HumanEval >80% predictable at the target 1B scale with just 0.01% of the compute.  <br>  <br>

23. ***VisualPuzzles for Evaluating Multimodal Reasoning:   <br>CMU introduces VisualPuzzles, a benchmark minimizing domain knowledge to evaluate visual reasoning, showing current models lag human performance. Evaluations show that state-of-the-art multimodal large language models consistently lag behind human performance on VisualPuzzles, and that strong performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks does not necessarily translate to success on reasoning-focused, knowledge-light tasks***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 15, CMU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10342) “VisualPuzzles: Decoupling Multimodal Reasoning Evaluation from Domain Knowledge”. Current multimodal benchmarks often conflate reasoning with domain-specific knowledge, making it difficult to isolate and evaluate general reasoning abilities in non-expert settings. To address this, the study introduces VisualPuzzles, a benchmark that targets visual reasoning while deliberately minimizing reliance on specialized knowledge. VisualPuzzles consists of diverse questions spanning five categories: algorithmic, analogical, deductive, inductive, and spatial reasoning. One major source of the questions is manually translated logical reasoning questions from the Chinese Civil Service Examination. Experiments show that VisualPuzzles requires significantly less intensive domain-specific knowledge and more complex reasoning compared to benchmarks like MMMU, enabling to better evaluate genuine multimodal reasoning. Evaluations show that state-of-the-art multimodal large language models consistently lag behind human performance on VisualPuzzles, and that strong performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks does not necessarily translate to success on reasoning-focused, knowledge-light tasks. Additionally, reasoning enhancements such as scaling up inference compute (with "thinking" modes) yield inconsistent gains across models and task types, and the work observes no clear correlation between model size and performance. The study also found that models exhibit different reasoning and answering patterns on VisualPuzzles compared to benchmarks with heavier emphasis on knowledge. VisualPuzzles offers a clearer lens through which to evaluate reasoning capabilities beyond factual recall and domain knowledge.  <br>  <br>

25. ***LLMs for Classifying Legal Interpretations:   <br>Uni of Zurich studies the identifiability of legal interpretations employed by the European Court of Human Rights using LLMs, showing that LLMs can classify legal interpretations and extract complex legal features efficiently. The results imply that feature-extraction using LLMs leads to robust outcomes while allowing for greater resource- and time efficiency compared to human annotation.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 15, Uni of Zurich published a [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10506-025-09447-9) “Classifying legal interpretations using large language models”. In the civil law tradition, legal arguments are used to justify the outcomes of judicial decision-making. These arguments are formed relying on a canon of interpretation techniques (e.g. textual or teleological interpretation). The work studies the identifiability of interpretation techniques as they are employed by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) from a computational law perspective using a unique dataset. The study shows how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be utilized to classify legal interpretations, and compares their performance. The work evaluates proprietary and opensource models using methods such as few-shot and zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting combined with self-consistency. The results imply that feature-extraction using LLMs leads to robust outcomes while allowing for greater resource- and time efficiency compared to human annotation. Furthermore, The results imply that LLMs can play a larger role in the extraction of more complex features that are of particular relevance from a legal perspective.  <br>  <br>

27. ***Reasoning Without Explicit "Thinking" Can Be Effective:   <br>UC Berkeley and Allen Inst for AI find that bypassing the explicit thinking process in LLMs can be surprisingly effective for reasoning tasks, especially in low-budget settings. When controlling for the number of tokens, NoThinking outperforms Thinking across a diverse set of seven challenging reasoning datasets***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 14, UC Berkeley and Allen Inst for AI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09858?) “Reasoning Models Can Be Effective Without Thinking”. Recent LLMs have significantly improved reasoning capabilities, primarily by including an explicit, lengthy Thinking process as part of generation. The study questions whether this explicit thinking is necessary. Using the state-of-the-art DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen, the work finds that bypassing the thinking process via simple prompting, denoted as NoThinking, can be surprisingly effective. When controlling for the number of tokens, NoThinking outperforms Thinking across a diverse set of seven challenging reasoning datasets--including mathematical problem solving, formal theorem proving, and coding--especially in low-budget settings, e.g., 51.3 vs. 28.9 on ACM 23 with 700 tokens. Notably, the performance of NoThinking becomes more competitive with pass@k as k increases. Building on this observation, the study demonstrates that a parallel scaling approach that uses NoThinking to generate N outputs independently and aggregates them is highly effective. For aggregation, the study uses task-specific verifiers when available, or apply simple best-of-N strategies such as confidence-based selection. The method outperforms a range of baselines with similar latency using Thinking, and is comparable to Thinking with significantly longer latency (up to 9x). Together, the research encourages a reconsideration of the necessity of lengthy thinking processes, while also establishing a competitive reference for achieving strong reasoning performance in low-budget settings or at low latency using parallel scaling.  <br>  <br>

29. ***Analyzing Post-Training Data Quality Through Layer-wise Gradients:   <br>Uni of Maryland and Uni of Chicago analyze layer-wise gradients to understand how instruction and reasoning data affect LLM post-training, revealing that higher-quality data is associated with lower nuclear norms and higher effective ranks. The analysis reveals that widely-studied metrics for data evaluation can be explained and unified by spectral properties computed from gradients' singular value decomposition (SVD)***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 14, Uni of Maryland and Uni of Chicago published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10766) “How Instruction and Reasoning Data shape Post-Training: Data Quality through the Lens of Layer-wise Gradients”. As the post-training of large language models (LLMs) advances from instruction-following to complex reasoning tasks, understanding how different data affect finetuning dynamics remains largely unexplored. This study presents a spectral analysis of layer-wise gradients induced by low/high-quality instruction and reasoning data for LLM post-training. The analysis reveals that widely-studied metrics for data evaluation, e.g., IFD, InsTag, Difficulty, and Reward, can be explained and unified by spectral properties computed from gradients' singular value decomposition (SVD). Specifically, higher-quality data are usually associated with lower nuclear norms and higher effective ranks. Notably, effective rank exhibits better robustness and resolution than nuclear norm in capturing subtle quality differences. For example, reasoning data achieves substantially higher effective ranks than instruction data, implying richer gradient structures on more complex tasks. Experiments also highlight that models within the same family share similar gradient patterns regardless of their sizes, whereas different model families diverge significantly. Providing a unified view on the effects of data quality across instruction and reasoning data, this work illuminates the interplay between data quality and training stability, shedding novel insights into developing better data exploration strategies for post-training.  <br>  <br>

31. ***End-to-End Training for Latent Diffusion Transformers:   <br>ANU, CSRIO, and NYU introduce REPA-E, a training recipe that unlocks end-to-end training of latent diffusion models with VAE tokenizers, significantly speeding up training and improving performance.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 14, ANU, CSRIO, and NYU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10483) “REPA-E: Unlocking VAE for End-to-End Tuning with Latent Diffusion Transformers”. The study tackles a fundamental question: "Can we train latent diffusion models together with the variational auto-encoder (VAE) tokenizer in an end-to-end manner?" Traditional deep-learning wisdom dictates that end-to-end training is often preferable when possible. However, for latent diffusion transformers, it is observed that end-to-end training both VAE and diffusion-model using standard diffusion-loss is ineffective, even causing a degradation in final performance. The study shows that while diffusion loss is ineffective, end-to-end training can be unlocked through the representation-alignment (REPA) loss -- allowing both VAE and diffusion model to be jointly tuned during the training process. Despite its simplicity, the proposed training recipe (REPA-E) shows remarkable performance; speeding up diffusion model training by over 17x and 45x over REPA and vanilla training recipes, respectively. Interestingly, the study observes that end-to-end tuning with REPA-E also improves the VAE itself; leading to improved latent space structure and downstream generation performance. In terms of final performance, the approach sets a new state-of-the-art; achieving FID of 1.26 and 1.83 with and without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet 256 x 256. Code is available at https://end2end-diffusion.github.io.  <br>  <br>

33. ***LLMs Exhibit "Priming" Effect When Learning New Data:   <br>Google demonstrates that LLMs exhibit a "priming" effect, inappropriately applying new knowledge in unrelated contexts, and introduces techniques to mitigate this while preserving learning ability. The study develops two novel techniques to modulate how new knowledge affects existing model behavior: (1) a stepping-stone'' text augmentation strategy and (2) an ignore-k'' update pruning method.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 13, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09522) “How new data permeates LLM knowledge and how to dilute it”. Large language models continually learn through the accumulation of gradient-based updates, but how individual pieces of new information affect existing knowledge, leading to both beneficial generalization and problematic hallucination, remains poorly understood. The study demonstrates that when learning new information, LLMs exhibit a "priming" effect: learning a new fact can cause the model to inappropriately apply that knowledge in unrelated contexts. To systematically study this phenomenon, the study introduces "Outlandish," a carefully curated dataset of 1320 diverse text samples designed to probe how new knowledge permeates through an LLM's existing knowledge base. Using this dataset, the study shows that the degree of priming after learning new information can be predicted by measuring the token probability of key words before training. This relationship holds robustly across different model architectures (PALM-2, Gemma, Llama), sizes, and training stages. Finally, the study develops two novel techniques to modulate how new knowledge affects existing model behavior: (1) a stepping-stone'' text augmentation strategy and (2) an ignore-k'' update pruning method. These approaches reduce undesirable priming effects by 50-95% while preserving the model's ability to learn new information. The findings provide both empirical insights into how LLMs learn and practical tools for improving the specificity of knowledge insertion in language models.

35. ***Speculative Thinking Enhances Small-Model Reasoning:   <br>Case Western Reserve Uni and CMU introduce Speculative Thinking, a training-free framework that enhances small-model reasoning by using large model guidance at inference time, delegating reflective steps to a more capable model to boost accuracy and shorten output.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 12, Case Western Reserve Uni and CMU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12329) “Speculative Thinking: Enhancing Small-Model Reasoning with Large Model Guidance at Inference Time”. Recent advances leverage post-training to enhance model reasoning performance, which typically requires costly training pipelines and still suffers from inefficient, overly lengthy outputs. The study introduces Speculative Thinking, a training-free framework that enables large reasoning models to guide smaller ones during inference at the reasoning level, distinct from speculative decoding, which operates at the token level. The approach is based on two observations: (1) reasoning-supportive tokens such as "wait" frequently appear after structural delimiters like "\n\n", serving as signals for reflection or continuation; and (2) larger models exhibit stronger control over reflective behavior, reducing unnecessary backtracking while improving reasoning quality. By strategically delegating reflective steps to a more capable model, the method significantly boosts the reasoning accuracy of reasoning models while shortening their output. With the assistance of the 32B reasoning model, the 1.5B model's accuracy on MATH500 increases from 83.2% to 89.4%, marking a substantial improvement of 6.2%. Simultaneously, the average output length is reduced from 5439 tokens to 4583 tokens, representing a 15.7% decrease. Moreover, when applied to a non-reasoning model (Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct), the framework boosts its accuracy from 74.0% to 81.8% on the same benchmark, achieving a relative improvement of 7.8%. https://github.com/uservan/speculative_thinking  <br>  <br>

    Apr 11, Google and Uni of Oxford published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08934) “Long Context In-Context Compression by Getting to the Gist of Gisting”. Long context processing is critical for the adoption of LLMs, but existing methods often introduce architectural complexity that hinders their practical adoption. Gisting, an in-context compression method with no architectural modification to the decoder transformer, is a promising approach due to its simplicity and compatibility with existing frameworks. While effective for short instructions, the work demonstrates that gisting struggles with longer contexts, with significant performance drops even at minimal compression rates. Surprisingly, a simple average pooling baseline consistently outperforms gisting. The study analyzes the limitations of gisting, including information flow interruptions, capacity limitations and the inability to restrict its attention to subsets of the context. Motivated by theoretical insights into the performance gap between gisting and average pooling, and supported by extensive experimentation, the work proposes GistPool, a new in-context compression method. GistPool preserves the simplicity of gisting, while significantly boosting its performance on long context compression tasks.  <br>  <br>

39. ***Impact of Web Crawling Opt-Outs on LLM Performance:   <br>EPFL and ETH Switzerland's study quantifies the "data compliance gap," finding that compliance with web data opt-outs does not degrade general knowledge acquisition but can impact performance in specialized domains.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 8, EPFL and ETH Switzerland published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06219) “Can Performant LLMs Be Ethical? Quantifying the Impact of Web Crawling Opt-Outs”. The increasing adoption of web crawling opt-outs by copyright holders of online content raises critical questions about the impact of data compliance on large language model (LLM) performance. However, little is known about how these restrictions (and the resultant filtering of pretraining datasets) affect the capabilities of models trained using these corpora. This study conceptualizes this effect as the data compliance gap (DCG), which quantifies the performance difference between models trained on datasets that comply with web crawling opt-outs, and those that do not. The study measures the data compliance gap in two settings: pretraining models from scratch and continual pretraining from existing compliant models (simulating a setting where copyrighted data could be integrated later in pretraining). Experiments with 1.5B models show that, as of January 2025, compliance with web data opt-outs does not degrade general knowledge acquisition (close to 0\% DCG). However, in specialized domains such as biomedical research, excluding major publishers leads to performance declines. These findings suggest that while general-purpose LLMs can be trained to perform equally well using fully open data, performance in specialized domains may benefit from access to high-quality copyrighted sources later in training. The study provides empirical insights into the long-debated trade-off between data compliance and downstream model performance, informing future discussions on AI training practices and policy decisions.  <br>  <br>

41. ***Low-Rank Thinning for Data Summarization:   <br>Uni of Cambridge, Cornell Tech, MIT and Microsoft revise the paper and introduce a new low-rank analysis of sub-Gaussian thinning that applies to any distribution and any kernel, guaranteeing high-quality compression whenever the kernel or data matrix is approximately low-rank.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 8, Uni of Cambridge, Cornell Tech, MIT and Microsoft revised the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12063) “Low-Rank Thinning”. The goal in thinning is to summarize a dataset using a small set of representative points. Remarkably, sub-Gaussian thinning algorithms like Kernel Halving and Compress can match the quality of uniform subsampling while substantially reducing the number of summary points. However, existing guarantees cover only a restricted range of distributions and kernel-based quality measures and suffer from pessimistic dimension dependence. To address these deficiencies, the study introduces a new low-rank analysis of sub-Gaussian thinning that applies to any distribution and any kernel, guaranteeing high-quality compression whenever the kernel or data matrix is approximately low-rank. To demonstrate the broad applicability of the techniques, the study designs practical sub-Gaussian thinning approaches that improve upon the best known guarantees for approximating attention in transformers, accelerating stochastic gradient training through reordering, and distinguishing distributions in near-linear time.  <br>  <br>

    Mar 28, CMU, Stanford Uni, Harvard Uni, Princeton Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19206) “Overtrained Language Models Are Harder to Fine-Tune”. Large language models are pre-trained on ever-growing token budgets under the assumption that better pre-training performance translates to improved downstream models. This work challenges this assumption and show that extended pre-training can make models harder to fine-tune, leading to degraded final performance. The authors term this phenomenon catastrophic overtraining. For example, the instruction-tuned OLMo-1B model pre-trained on 3T tokens leads to over 2% worse performance on multiple standard LLM benchmarks than its 2.3T token counterpart. Through controlled experiments and theoretical analysis, the work shows that catastrophic overtraining arises from a systematic increase in the broad sensitivity of pre-trained parameters to modifications, including but not limited to fine-tuning. The findings call for a critical reassessment of pre-training design that considers the downstream adaptability of the model.

1. ***Self-Steering LMs with DisCIPL:   <br>MIT and Yule introduce DisCIPL, a method for "self-steering" LMs using a Planner model to generate task-specific inference programs executed by Follower models, enabling recursive search and efficient reasoning, achieving performance comparable to larger models on constrained generation tasks.***  <br>  <br>
   Apr 11, MIT and Yule published an ICLR [paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=x7E2Qt7n0V) “Self-Steering Language Models”. While test-time reasoning enables language models to tackle complex tasks, searching or planning in natural language can be slow, costly, and error-prone. But even when LMs struggle to emulate the precise reasoning steps needed to solve a problem, they often excel at describing its abstract structure--both how to verify solutions and how to search for them. This paper introduces DisCIPL, a method for “self-steering” LMs where a Planner model generates a task-specific inference program that is executed by a population of Follower models. The approach equips LMs with the ability to write recursive search procedures that guide LM inference, enabling new forms of verifiable and efficient reasoning. When instantiated with a small Follower (e.g., Llama-3.2-1B), DisCIPL matches (and sometimes outperforms) much larger models, including GPT-4o and o1, on challenging constrained generation tasks. In decoupling planning from execution, the work opens up a design space of highly-parallelized Monte Carlo inference strategies that outperform standard best-of-N sampling, require no finetuning, and can be implemented automatically by existing LMs.  <br>  <br>

3. ***Dynamic Cheatsheet Augments LMs with Adaptive Memory:   <br>Stanford and Together AI present Dynamic Cheatsheet (DC), a framework that endows black-box LMs with a persistent, evolving memory to store and reuse accumulated strategies and insights, substantially enhancing performance across a range of tasks without explicit ground-truth labels or finetuning.***  <br>  <br>
   Apr 10, Stanford Uni and Together AI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07952) “Dynamic Cheatsheet: Test-Time Learning with Adaptive Memory”. Despite their impressive performance on complex tasks, current language models (LMs) typically operate in a vacuum: Each input query is processed separately, without retaining insights from previous attempts. Here, the study presents Dynamic Cheatsheet (DC), a lightweight framework that endows a black-box LM with a persistent, evolving memory. Rather than repeatedly re-discovering or re-committing the same solutions and mistakes, DC enables models to store and reuse accumulated strategies, code snippets, and general problem-solving insights at inference time. This test-time learning enhances performance substantially across a range of tasks without needing explicit ground-truth labels or human feedback. Leveraging DC, Claude 3.5 Sonnet's accuracy more than doubled on AIME math exams once it began retaining algebraic insights across questions. Similarly, GPT-4o's success rate on Game of 24 increased from 10% to 99% after the model discovered and reused a Python-based solution. In tasks prone to arithmetic mistakes, such as balancing equations, DC enabled GPT-4o and Claude to reach near-perfect accuracy by recalling previously validated code, whereas their baselines stagnated around 50%. Beyond arithmetic challenges, DC yields notable accuracy gains on knowledge-demanding tasks. Claude achieved a 9% improvement in GPQA-Diamond and an 8% boost on MMLU-Pro problems. Crucially, DC's memory is self-curated, focusing on concise, transferable snippets rather than entire transcript. Unlike finetuning or static retrieval methods, DC adapts LMs' problem-solving skills on the fly, without modifying their underlying parameters. Overall, the findings present DC as a promising approach for augmenting LMs with persistent memory, bridging the divide between isolated inference events and the cumulative, experience-driven learning characteristic of human cognition. https://github.com/suzgunmirac/dynamic-cheatsheet  <br>  <br>

7. ***Google Explores Intrinsic Motivation for Mutual Awareness:   <br>Google's paper explores the intrinsic motivation for mutual awareness, hypothesizing that humans possess a fundamental drive to understand and be understood, even without extrinsic rewards, and demonstrates that this drive can facilitate cooperation.***  <br>  <br>
   Apr 10, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06611) “Wanting to be Understood”. This paper explores an intrinsic motivation for mutual awareness, hypothesizing that humans possess a fundamental drive to understand and to be understood even in the absence of extrinsic rewards. Through simulations of the perceptual crossing paradigm, the study explores the effect of various internal reward functions in reinforcement learning agents. The drive to understand is implemented as an active inference type artificial curiosity reward, whereas the drive to be understood is implemented through intrinsic rewards for imitation, influence/impressionability, and sub-reaction time anticipation of the other. Results indicate that while artificial curiosity alone does not lead to a preference for social interaction, rewards emphasizing reciprocal understanding successfully drive agents to prioritize interaction. The work demonstrates that this intrinsic motivation can facilitate cooperation in tasks where only one agent receives extrinsic reward for the behaviour of the other.  <br>  <br>

9. ***New Ideas in AI Stem from New Datasets:   <br>Jack Morris argues that major AI breakthroughs aren't primarily driven by novel algorithms but by the unlocking and large-scale utilization of new data sources, predicting that the next major paradigm shift will arise from harnessing vast, currently untapped data reservoirs.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 10, Jack Morris, a PhD student from Cornell Tech Inst published an [article](https://substack.com/inbox/post/160974493) “There Are No New Ideas in AI… Only New Datasets”. While AI showcases steady advancements often attributed to ongoing research, truly transformative leaps like Deep Neural Networks, Transformers, RLHF, and Reasoning models are rarer, and recent progress appears incremental. This text argues that these major breakthroughs weren't primarily driven by fundamentally novel algorithms, as the core machine learning concepts pre-existed. Instead, their catalyst was the unlocking and large-scale utilization of new data sources: ImageNet, web text, human preferences, and verifiable outputs, respectively. This perspective emphasizes data availability and scale as potentially more crucial for significant progress than specific algorithmic innovations, aligning with the "Bitter Lesson." Consequently, the next major AI paradigm shift is predicted to arise not just from new methods, but from harnessing vast, currently untapped data reservoirs, with video platforms like YouTube and data from embodied systems (robots) being prominent examples. The search for future breakthroughs might prioritize accessing new data over inventing new techniques. A [2023 blog](https://nonint.com/2023/06/10/the-it-in-ai-models-is-the-dataset/) also stated that “Then, when you refer to “Lambda”, “ChatGPT”, “Bard”, or “Claude” then, it’s not the model weights that you are referring to.

Inference, a parallel LLM inference engine that allows multiple instances of the same LLM to run in parallel with a shared attention cache, enabling them to synchronize and devise their own collaboration strategies, improving hardware utilization.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 9, Yandex and IST Austria published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06261) “Hogwild! Inference: Parallel LLM Generation via Concurrent Attention”. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to tackle increasingly complex tasks through advanced reasoning, long-form content generation, and tool use. Solving these tasks often involves long inference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to expedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks, exploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown that LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation frameworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. However, each of these frameworks may not be suitable for all types of tasks, which can hinder their applicability. This work proposes a different design approach: running LLM "workers" in parallel , allowing them to synchronize via a concurrently-updated attention cache and prompt these workers to decide how best to collaborate. The approach allows the instances to come up with their own collaboration strategy for the problem at hand, all the while "seeing" each other's partial progress in the concurrent cache. The study implements this approach via Hogwild! Inference: a parallel LLM inference engine where multiple instances of the same LLM run in parallel with the same attention cache, with "instant" access to each other's generated tokens. Hogwild! inference takes advantage of Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to avoid recomputation while improving parallel hardware utilization. The study finds that modern reasoning-capable LLMs can perform inference with shared Key-Value cache out of the box, without additional fine-tuning. https://github.com/eqimp/hogwild_llm  <br>  <br>

13. ***SkillWeaver Enables Web Agents to Self-Improve:   <br>Ohio State University, University of Virginia, Purdue University, CMU, and Cisco introduce SkillWeaver, a framework enabling web agents to self-improve by autonomously synthesizing reusable skills as APIs, expanding their capabilities through iterative exploration and skill composition.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 9, Ohio State Uni, Uni of Virginia, Prude Uni, CMU and Cisco published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07079) “SkillWeaver: Web Agents can Self-Improve by Discovering and Honing Skills”. To survive and thrive in complex environments, humans have evolved sophisticated self-improvement mechanisms through environment exploration, hierarchical abstraction of experiences into reuseable skills, and collaborative construction of an ever-growing skill repertoire. Despite recent advancements, autonomous web agents still lack crucial self-improvement capabilities, struggling with procedural knowledge abstraction, refining skills, and skill composition. This study introduces SkillWeaver, a skill-centric framework enabling agents to self-improve by autonomously synthesizing reusable skills as APIs. Given a new website, the agent autonomously discovers skills, executes them for practice, and distills practice experiences into robust APIs. Iterative exploration continually expands a library of lightweight, plug-and-play APIs, significantly enhancing the agent's capabilities. Experiments on WebArena and real-world websites demonstrate the efficacy of SkillWeaver, achieving relative success rate improvements of 31.8% and 39.8%, respectively. Additionally, APIs synthesized by strong agents substantially enhance weaker agents through transferable skills, yielding improvements of up to 54.3% on WebArena. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of honing diverse website interactions into APIs, which can be seamlessly shared among various web agents.  <br>  <br>

    Apr 9, Allen Inst for AI, Uni of Washington, UC Berkeley and Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07096) “OLMoTrace: Tracing Language Model Outputs Back to Trillions of Training Tokens”. The study presents OLMoTrace, the first system that traces the outputs of language models back to their full, multi-trillion-token training data in real time. OLMoTrace finds and shows verbatim matches between segments of language model output and documents in the training text corpora. Powered by an extended version of infini-gram (Liu et al., 2024), the system returns tracing results within a few seconds. OLMoTrace can help users understand the behavior of language models through the lens of their training data. The study showcases how it can be used to explore fact checking, hallucination, and the creativity of language models. OLMoTrace is publicly available and fully open-source.  <br>  <br>

    Apr 8, Sakana.AI published a [paper](https://pub.sakana.ai/ai-scientist-v2/paper/paper.pdf) “The AI Scientist-v2: Workshop-Level Automated Scientific Discovery via Agentic Tree Search”. AI is increasingly playing a pivotal role in transforming how scientific discoveries are made.

Additionally, the work enhances the AI reviewer component by integrating a Vision-Language Model (VLM) feedback loop for iterative refinement of content and aesthetics of the figures. The study evaluated The AI Scientist-v2 by submitting three fully autonomous manuscripts to a peer-reviewed ICLR workshop. Notably, one manuscript achieved high enough scores to exceed the average human acceptance threshold, marking the first instance of a fully AI-generated paper successfully navigating a peer review. This accomplishment highlights the growing capability of AI in conducting all aspects of scientific research.

19. ***Reproducibility in LM Reasoning Critically Assessed:   <br>The University of Tubingen and the University of Cambridge conduct a comprehensive study revealing that current mathematical reasoning benchmarks are highly sensitive to subtle implementation choices, calling for standardized evaluation frameworks and finding that SFT methods show consistently stronger generalization.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 9, Uni of Tubingen and Uni of Cambridge published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07086) “A Sober Look at Progress in Language Model Reasoning: Pitfalls and Paths to Reproducibility”. Reasoning has emerged as the next major frontier for language models (LMs), with rapid advances from both academic and industrial labs. However, this progress often outpaces methodological rigor, with many evaluations relying on benchmarking practices that lack transparency, robustness, or statistical grounding. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study and find that current mathematical reasoning benchmarks are highly sensitive to subtle implementation choices - including decoding parameters, random seeds, prompt formatting, and even hardware and software-framework configurations. Performance gains reported in recent studies frequently hinge on unclear comparisons or unreported sources of variance. To address these issues, we propose a standardized evaluation framework with clearly defined best practices and reporting standards. Using this framework, we reassess recent methods and find that reinforcement learning (RL) approaches yield only modest improvements - far below prior claims - and are prone to overfitting, especially on small-scale benchmarks like AIME24. In contrast, supervised finetuning (SFT) methods show consistently stronger generalization. To foster reproducibility, we release all code, prompts, and model outputs, for reasoning benchmarks, establishing more rigorous foundations for future work  <br>  <br>

    Apr 8, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05646) “Lattice: Learning to Efficiently Compress the Memory”. Attention mechanisms have revolutionized sequence learning but suffer from quadratic computational complexity. This paper introduces Lattice, a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) mechanism that leverages the inherent low-rank structure of K-V matrices to efficiently compress the cache into a fixed number of memory slots, achieving sub-quadratic complexity. The study formulates this compression as an online optimization problem and derive a dynamic memory update rule based on a single gradient descent step. The resulting recurrence features a state- and input-dependent gating mechanism, offering an interpretable memory update process. The core innovation is the orthogonal update: each memory slot is updated exclusively with information orthogonal to its current state hence incorporation of only novel, non-redundant data, which minimizes the interference with previously stored information. The experimental results show that Lattice achieves the best perplexity compared to all baselines across diverse context lengths, with performance improvement becoming more pronounced as the context length increases.  <br>  <br>

23. ***Knowledge-Instruct Enables Effective Continual Pre-training:   <br>Microsoft introduces Knowledge-Instruct, a novel approach to efficiently inject knowledge from limited corpora into LLMs through pure instruction-tuning, effectively integrating new knowledge while preserving general reasoning abilities.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 8, Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05571) “Knowledge-Instruct: Effective Continual Pre-training from Limited Data using Instructions”. While Large Language Models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge during pre-training, they often lack domain-specific, new, or niche information. Continual pre-training (CPT) attempts to address this gap but suffers from catastrophic forgetting and inefficiencies in low-data regimes. The study introduces Knowledge-Instruct, a novel approach to efficiently inject knowledge from limited corpora through pure instruction-tuning. By generating information-dense synthetic instruction data, it effectively integrates new knowledge while preserving general reasoning and instruction-following abilities. Knowledge-Instruct demonstrates superior factual memorization, minimizes catastrophic forgetting, and remains scalable by leveraging synthetic data from relatively small language models. Additionally, it enhances contextual understanding, including complex multi-hop reasoning, facilitating integration with retrieval systems. The work validates its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks, including Companies, a new dataset that is released to measure knowledge injection capabilities.  <br>  <br>

    Apr 8, Salesforce published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03601) “APIGen-MT: Agentic Pipeline for Multi-Turn Data Generation via Simulated Agent-Human Interplay”. Training effective AI agents for multi-turn interactions requires high-quality data that captures realistic human-agent dynamics, yet such data is scarce and expensive to collect manually. The work introduces APIGen-MT, a two-phase framework that generates verifiable and diverse multi-turn agent data. In the first phase, the agentic pipeline produces detailed task blueprints with ground-truth actions, leveraging a committee of LLM reviewers and iterative feedback loops. These blueprints are then transformed into complete interaction trajectories through simulated human-agent interplay. The study trains a family of models -- the xLAM-2-fc-r series with sizes ranging from 1B to 70B parameters. The models outperform frontier models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 on tau-bench and BFCL benchmarks, with the smaller models surpassing their larger counterparts, particularly in multi-turn settings, while maintaining superior consistency across multiple trials. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the verified blueprint-to-details approach yields high-quality training data, enabling the development of more reliable, efficient, and capable agents.

29. ***Adaptive Weighted Rejection Sampling Improves LM Generation:   <br>MIT, ETH, et al. introduce a new algorithm for controlled generation from language models with constraints, using adaptive rejection sampling to avoid evaluating constraints on the full vocabulary at each step and correcting for myopic behavior through importance weighting, improving both runtime and performance.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 7, MIT, ETH, et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05410) “Fast Controlled Generation from Language Models with Adaptive Weighted Rejection Sampling”. The dominant approach to generating from language models subject to some constraint is locally constrained decoding (LCD), incrementally sampling tokens at each time step such that the constraint is never violated. Typically, this is achieved through token masking: looping over the vocabulary and excluding non-conforming tokens. There are two important problems with this approach. (i) Evaluating the constraint on every token can be prohibitively expensive -- LM vocabularies often exceed 100,000 tokens. (ii) LCD can distort the global distribution over strings, sampling tokens based only on local information, even if they lead down dead-end paths. This work introduces a new algorithm that addresses both these problems. First, to avoid evaluating a constraint on the full vocabulary at each step of generation, the study proposes an adaptive rejection sampling algorithm that typically requires orders of magnitude fewer constraint evaluations. Second, the work shows how this algorithm can be extended to produce low-variance, unbiased estimates of importance weights at a very small additional cost -- estimates that can be soundly used within previously proposed sequential Monte Carlo algorithms to correct for the myopic behavior of local constraint enforcement. Through extensive empirical evaluation in text-to-SQL, molecular synthesis, goal inference, pattern matching, and JSON domains, the study shows that the approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines, supporting a broader class of constraints and improving both runtime and performance. Additional theoretical and empirical analyses show that the method's runtime efficiency is driven by its dynamic use of computation, scaling with the divergence between the unconstrained and constrained LM, and as a consequence, runtime improvements are greater for better models.  <br>  <br>

    Apr 7, Nvidia, Stanford Uni, UCSD, UC Berkeley and UT Austin published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05298) on CPPR2025 “One-Minute Video Generation with Test-Time Training”. Transformers today still struggle to generate one-minute videos because self-attention layers are inefficient for long context. Alternatives such as Mamba layers struggle with complex multi-scene stories because their hidden states are less expressive. The study experiments with Test-Time Training (TTT) layers, whose hidden states themselves can be neural networks, therefore more expressive. Adding TTT layers into a pre-trained Transformer enables it to generate one-minute videos from text storyboards. For proof of concept, the work curates a dataset based on Tom and Jerry cartoons. Compared to baselines such as Mamba~2, Gated DeltaNet, and sliding-window attention layers, TTT layers generate much more coherent videos that tell complex stories, leading by 34 Elo points in a human evaluation of 100 videos per method. Although promising, results still contain artifacts, likely due to the limited capability of the pre-trained 5B model. The efficiency of the implementation can also be improved. The authors have only experimented with one-minute videos due to resource constraints, but the approach can be extended to longer videos and more complex stories. Sample videos, code and annotations are available at: https://test-time-training.github.io/video-dit  <br>  <br>

Reinforcement learning has been shown to improve the performance of large language models. However, traditional approaches like RLHF or RLAIF treat the problem as single-step. As focus shifts toward more complex reasoning and agentic tasks, language models must take multiple steps of text generation, reasoning and environment interaction before generating a solution. The study proposes a synthetic data generation and RL methodology targeting multi-step optimization scenarios. This approach, called Step-Wise Reinforcement Learning (SWiRL), iteratively generates multi-step reasoning and tool use data, and then learns from that data. It employs a simple step-wise decomposition that breaks each multi-step trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories corresponding to each action by the original model. It then applies synthetic data filtering and RL optimization on these sub-trajectories. The study evaluated SWiRL on a number of multi-step tool use, question answering, and mathematical reasoning tasks. Experiments show that SWiRL outperforms baseline approaches by 21.5%, 12.3%, 14.8%, 11.1%, and 15.3% in relative accuracy on GSM8K, HotPotQA, CofCA, MuSiQue, and BeerQA, respectively. Excitingly, the approach exhibits generalization across tasks: for example, training only on HotPotQA (text question-answering) improves zero-shot performance on GSM8K (a math dataset) by a relative 16.9%.  <br>  <br>

35. ***Auditing Model Substitution in LLM APIs:   <br>UC Berkeley formalizes the problem of model substitution detection in LLM APIs, evaluating existing verification techniques and discussing the potential of hardware-based solutions like Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) as a pathway towards provable model integrity.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 6, UC Berkeley published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04715) “Are You Getting What You Pay For? Auditing Model Substitution in LLM APIs”. The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) accessed via black-box APIs introduces a significant trust challenge: users pay for services based on advertised model capabilities (e.g., size, performance), but providers may covertly substitute the specified model with a cheaper, lower-quality alternative to reduce operational costs. This lack of transparency undermines fairness, erodes trust, and complicates reliable benchmarking. Detecting such substitutions is difficult due to the black-box nature, typically limiting interaction to input-output queries. This paper formalizes the problem of model substitution detection in LLM APIs. The study systematically evaluates existing verification techniques, including output-based statistical tests, benchmark evaluations, and log probability analysis, under various realistic attack scenarios like model quantization, randomized substitution, and benchmark evasion. Findings reveal the limitations of methods relying solely on text outputs, especially against subtle or adaptive attacks. While log probability analysis offers stronger guarantees when available, its accessibility is often limited. The work concludes by discussing the potential of hardware-based solutions like Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) as a pathway towards provable model integrity, highlighting the trade-offs between security, performance, and provider adoption.

37. ***Retro-Search Distills Higher Quality Reasoning Paths:   <br>Nvidia, University of Washington, and Stanford University introduce Retro-Search, an MCTS-inspired search algorithm for distilling higher quality reasoning paths from large reasoning models, enabling models to self-improve or weak models to improve stronger models' traces, resulting in shorter and faster inference.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 6, Nvidia, Uni of Washington and Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04383) “Retro-Search: Exploring Untaken Paths for Deeper and Efficient Reasoning”. Large reasoning models exhibit remarkable reasoning capabilities via long, elaborate reasoning trajectories. Supervised fine-tuning on such reasoning traces, also known as distillation, can be a cost-effective way to boost reasoning capabilities of student models. However, empirical observations reveal that these reasoning trajectories are often suboptimal, switching excessively between different lines of thought, resulting in under-thinking, over-thinking, and even degenerate responses. The study introduces Retro-Search, an MCTS-inspired search algorithm, for distilling higher quality reasoning paths from large reasoning models. Retro-Search retrospectively revises reasoning paths to discover better, yet shorter traces, which can then lead to student models with enhanced reasoning capabilities with shorter, thus faster inference. The approach can enable two use cases: self-improvement, where models are fine-tuned on their own Retro-Search-ed thought traces, and weak-to-strong improvement, where a weaker model revises stronger model's thought traces via Retro-Search. For self-improving, R1-distill-7B, fine-tuned on its own Retro-Search-ed traces, reduces the average reasoning length by 31.2% while improving performance by 7.7% across seven math benchmarks. For weak-to-strong improvement, the work retrospectively revises R1-671B's traces from the OpenThoughts dataset using R1-distill-32B as the Retro-Search-er, a model 20x smaller. Qwen2.5-32B, fine-tuned on this refined data, achieves performance comparable to R1-distill-32B, yielding an 11.3% reduction in reasoning length and a 2.4% performance improvement compared to fine-tuning on the original OpenThoughts data. The work counters recently emergent viewpoints that question the relevance of search algorithms in the era of large reasoning models, by demonstrating that there are still opportunities for algorithmic advancements, even for frontier models.  <br>  <br>

39. ***Rethinking Temporal Search for Long-Form Video Understanding:   <br>Stanford University, Northwestern University, and CMU revisit temporal search paradigms for long-form video understanding, introducing LV-Haystack (a long video haystack problem) and propose T*, a lightweight temporal search framework that improves performance.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 6, Stanford Uni, Northwestern Uni and CMU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02259) “Re-thinking Temporal Search for Long-Form Video Understanding”. Efficiently understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge in computer vision. This study revisits temporal search paradigms for long-form video understanding and address a fundamental issue pertaining to all state-of-the-art (SOTA) long-context vision-language models (VLMs). The contributions are twofold: First, the work frames temporal search as a Long Video Haystack problem: finding a minimal set of relevant frames (e.g., one to five) from tens of thousands based on specific queries. Upon this formulation, the study introduces LV-Haystack, the first dataset with 480 hours of videos, 15,092 human-annotated instances for both training and evaluation aiming to improve temporal search quality and efficiency. Results on LV-Haystack highlight a significant research gap in temporal search capabilities, with current SOTA search methods only achieving 2.1% temporal F1 score on the Longvideobench subset. Next, inspired by visual search in images, the study proposes a lightweight temporal search framework, T* that reframes costly temporal search as spatial search. T* leverages powerful visual localization techniques commonly used in images and introduces an adaptive zooming-in mechanism that operates across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments show that integrating T* with existing methods significantly improves SOTA long-form video understanding. Under an inference budget of 32 frames, T* improves GPT-4o's performance from 50.5% to 53.1% and LLaVA-OneVision-OV-72B's performance from 56.5% to 62.4% on the Longvideobench XL subset.

41. ***Pretraining Scaling Law for LLM Reasoning Explored: UCSB, MIT-IBM, and Rutgers University explore the effects of scaling on LLMs' reasoning abilities, using a synthetic multihop reasoning environment, and find that overparameterization can impair reasoning performance due to excessive memorization, identifying an empirical scaling law for optimal model size.***
    Apr 4, UCSB, MIT-IBM and Rutgers Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03635) “Do Larger Language Models Imply Better Reasoning? A Pretraining Scaling Law for Reasoning”. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks requiring complex reasoning. However, the effects of scaling on their reasoning abilities remain insufficiently understood. This study introduces a synthetic multihop reasoning environment designed to closely replicate the structure and distribution of real-world large-scale knowledge graphs. Our reasoning task involves completing missing edges in the graph, which requires advanced multi-hop reasoning and mimics real-world reasoning scenarios. To evaluate this, the work pretrains language models (LMs) from scratch solely on triples from the incomplete graph and assess their ability to infer the missing edges. Interestingly, the study observes that overparameterization can impair reasoning performance due to excessive memorization. The study investigates different factors that affect this U-shaped loss curve, including graph structure, model size, and training steps. To predict the optimal model size for a specific knowledge graph, the work finds an empirical scaling that linearly maps the knowledge graph search entropy to the optimal model size. This work provides new insights into the relationship between scaling and reasoning in LLMs, shedding light on possible ways to optimize their performance for reasoning tasks.  <br>  <br>

43. ***CoT Faithfulness in Reasoning Models Examined:   <br>Anthropic explores the faithfulness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints, finding that while CoTs reveal hint usage, the reveal rate is often low and that RL improvements don't necessarily increase verbalization of hints, indicating CoT monitoring is promising but not sufficient for ensuring AI safety.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 3, Anthropic published a [paper](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/71876fabef0f0ed4/original/reasoning_models_paper.pdf) “Reasoning Models Don’t Always Say What They Think”. Chain-of-thought (CoT) offers a potential boon for AI safety as it allows monitoring a model’s CoT to try to understand its intentions and reasoning processes. However, the effectiveness of such monitoring hinges on CoTs faithfully representing models’ actual reasoning processes. The work evaluates CoT faithfulness of state-of-the-art reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints presented in the prompts and find: (1) for most settings and models tested, CoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1% of examples where they use the hint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2) outcome-based reinforcement learning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus without saturating, and (3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently hints are used (reward hacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase, even without training against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT monitoring is a promising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and evaluations, but that it is not sufficient to rule them out. They also suggest that in settings like ours where CoT reasoning is not necessary, test-time monitoring of CoTs is unlikely to reliably catch rare and catastrophic unexpected behaviors.  <br>  <br>

45. ***AI Conversations Improve Happiness:   <br>Yale University, UCL, Google, University of Oxford, and MPUCL find that conversations with AI chatbots can increase subjective well-being, particularly when discussing negative topics, due to the AI's positivity bias and its impact on emotional expectations.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 2, Yale Uni, UCL, Google, Uni of Oxford and MPUCL published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02091) “Increasing happiness through conversations with artificial intelligence”. Chatbots powered by artificial intelligence (AI) have rapidly become a significant part of everyday life, with over a quarter of American adults using them multiple times per week. While these tools offer potential benefits and risks, a fundamental question remains largely unexplored: How do conversations with AI influence subjective well-being? To investigate this, the work conducted a study where participants either engaged in conversations with an AI chatbot (N = 334) or wrote journal entires (N = 193) on the same randomly assigned topics and reported their momentary happiness afterward. The study found that happiness after AI chatbot conversations was higher than after journaling, particularly when discussing negative topics such as depression or guilt. Leveraging large language models for sentiment analysis, the work found that the AI chatbot mirrored participants' sentiment while maintaining a consistent positivity bias. When discussing negative topics, participants gradually aligned their sentiment with the AI's positivity, leading to an overall increase in happiness. The authors hypothesized that the history of participants' sentiment prediction errors, the difference between expected and actual emotional tone when responding to the AI chatbot, might explain this happiness effect. Using computational modeling, the work finds the history of these sentiment prediction errors over the course of a conversation predicts greater post-conversation happiness, demonstrating a central role of emotional expectations during dialogue. The findings underscore the effect that AI interactions can have on human well-being.  <br>  <br>

47. ***AI Judges Achieve Human Expert Equivalence in Design:   <br>  <br>MIT and Penn State University introduce a statistical framework to determine whether AI judges match human experts in design evaluation and find that reasoning-supported VLM models can achieve human-expert equivalence in design evaluation, potentially scaling design evaluation in education and practice.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 1, MIT and Penn State Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00938) “AI Judges in Design: Statistical Perspectives on Achieving Human Expert Equivalence With Vision-Language Models”. The subjective evaluation of early stage engineering designs, such as conceptual sketches, traditionally relies on human experts. However, expert evaluations are time-consuming, expensive, and sometimes inconsistent. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) offer the potential to automate design assessments, but it is crucial to ensure that these AI “judges” perform on par with human experts. However, no existing framework assesses expert equivalence. This paper introduces a rigorous statistical framework to determine whether an AI judge's ratings match those of human experts. The authors apply this framework in a case study evaluating four VLM-based judges on key design metrics (uniqueness, creativity, usefulness, and drawing quality). These AI judges employ various in-context learning (ICL) techniques, including uni- vs. multimodal prompts and inference-time reasoning. The same statistical framework is used to assess three trained novices for expert-equivalence. Results show that the top-performing AI judge, using text- and image-based ICL with reasoning, achieves expert-level agreement for uniqueness and drawing quality and outperforms or matches trained novices across all metrics. In 6/6 runs for both uniqueness and creativity, and 5/6 runs for both drawing quality and usefulness, its agreement with experts meets or exceeds that of the majority of trained novices. These findings suggest that reasoning-supported VLM models can achieve human-expert equivalence in design evaluation. This has implications for scaling design evaluation in education and practice, and provides a general statistical framework for validating AI judges in other domains requiring subjective content evaluation.

1. ***Meta Unveils Llama 4 Herd:   <br>Meta has released the Llama 4 herd of models, including Llama 4 Scout (a 17B parameter multimodal model with a 10M context window) and Llama 4 Maverick (a 17B parameter multimodal model outperforming GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash), both distilled from Llama 4 Behemoth, a powerful 288B parameter model that outperforms GPT-4.5 and other models on STEM benchmarks.***  <br>  <br>
   Apr 5, Meta [released Llama 4](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/) herd, which will enable people to build more personalized multimodal experiences. Llama 4 Scout, a 17 billion active parameter model with 16 experts, is the best multimodal model in the world in its class and is more powerful than all previous generation Llama models, while fitting in a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. Additionally, Llama 4 Scout offers an industry-leading context window of 10M and delivers better results than Gemma 3, Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, and Mistral 3.1 across a broad range of widely reported benchmarks. Llama 4 Maverick, a 17 billion active parameter model with 128 experts, is the best multimodal model in its class, beating GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash across a broad range of widely reported benchmarks, while achieving comparable results to the new DeepSeek v3 on reasoning and coding—at less than half the active parameters. Llama 4 Maverick offers a best-in-class performance to cost ratio with an experimental chat version scoring ELO of 1417 on LMArena. These models are Meta’s best yet thanks to distillation from Llama 4 Behemoth, a 288 billion active parameter model with 16 experts that is Meta’s most powerful yet and among the world’s smartest LLMs. Llama 4 Behemoth outperforms GPT-4.5, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and Gemini 2.0 Pro on several STEM benchmarks. Llama 4 Behemoth is still training. Llama 4 Scout and Llama 4 Maverick models are available at [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama) and llama.com  <br>  <br>

3. ***DeepSeek Explores Inference-Time Reward Scaling:   <br>DeepSeek and Tsinghua University's research explores improving reward modeling (RM) for LLMs with increased inference compute, proposing Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT) for scalable reward generation and a meta RM for better voting performance, resulting in DeepSeek-GRM models that outperform existing methods.***  <br>  <br>
   Apr 3, DeepSeek and Tsinghua Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02495) “Inference-Time Scaling for Generalist Reward Modeling”. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely adopted in post-training for large language models (LLMs) at scale. Recently, the incentivization of reasoning capabilities in LLMs from RL indicates that proper learning methods could enable effective inference-time scalability. A key challenge of RL is to obtain accurate reward signals for LLMs in various domains beyond verifiable questions or artificial rules. This work investigates how to improve reward modeling (RM) with more inference compute for general queries, i.e. the inference-time scalability of generalist RM, and further, how to improve the effectiveness of performance-compute scaling with proper learning methods. For the RM approach, the work adopts pointwise generative reward modeling (GRM) to enable flexibility for different input types and potential for inference-time scaling. For the learning method, the research proposes Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT) to foster scalable reward generation behaviors in GRMs through online RL, to generate principles adaptively and critiques accurately, resulting in DeepSeek-GRM models. Furthermore, for effective inference-time scaling, the study uses parallel sampling to expand compute usage, and introduce a meta RM to guide voting process for better scaling performance. Empirically, the authors show that SPCT significantly improves the quality and scalability of GRMs, outperforming existing methods and models in various RM benchmarks without severe biases, and could achieve better performance compared to training-time scaling. DeepSeek-GRM still meets challenges in some tasks, which the authors believe can be addressed by future efforts in generalist reward systems. The models will be released and open-sourced.  <br>  <br>

5. ***MIT Investigates AI Scientists' Agreement:   <br>MIT's paper "Do Two AI Scientists Agree" explores whether AI models trained on the same scientific task learn the same theories, finding that AI scientists tend to converge in their learned theories with more training data, using Hamiltonian-Lagrangian neural networks (MASS) as a tool for interpretation.***  <br>  <br>
   Apr 3, MIT published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02822v1) “Do Two AI Scientists Agree”. When two AI models are trained on the same scientific task, do they learn the same theory or two different theories? Throughout the history of science, people have witnessed the rise and fall of theories driven by experimental validation or falsification: many theories may co-exist when experimental data is lacking, but the space of surviving theories becomes more constrained with more experimental data becoming available. The work shows the same story is true for AI scientists. With increasingly more systems provided in training data, AI scientists tend to converge in the theories they learned, although sometimes they form distinct groups corresponding to different theories. To mechanistically interpret what theories AI scientists learn and quantify their agreement, the study proposes MASS, Hamiltonian-Lagrangian neural networks as AI Scientists, trained on standard problems in physics, aggregating training results across many seeds simulating the different configurations of AI scientists. The key findings include: 1) when trained on textbook problems in classical mechanics, AI scientists prefers either a complete Hamiltonian or Lagrangian description; 2) when extended to non-standard physical problems, the Lagrangian description generalizes, suggesting that Lagrangian dynamics remain as the singular accurate family of descriptions in a rich theory space. The work also observes strong seed dependence of the training dynamics and final learned weights, controlling the rise and fall of relevant theories. Besides interpretability, MASS unifies and generalizes beyond the Lagrangian neural networks and the Hamiltonian neural networks, providing a new tool for learning of dynamical systems.

7. ***Understanding Attention Sinks in LLMs:   <br>Researchers from the University of Oxford, National University of Singapore, and Google theoretically and empirically argue that the heavy attention LLMs give to the first token in a sequence, creating an "attention sink," is a mechanism to avoid over-mixing and relate it to how information propagates in Transformers.***  <br>  <br>
   Apr 3, Uni of Oxford, National Uni of Singapore and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02732) “Why do LLMs attend to the first token?”. Large Language Models (LLMs) tend to attend heavily to the first token in the sequence -- creating a so-called attention sink. Many works have studied this phenomenon in detail, proposing various ways to either leverage or alleviate it. Attention sinks have been connected to quantisation difficulties, security issues, and streaming attention. Yet, while many works have provided conditions in which they occur or not, a critical question remains shallowly answered: Why do LLMs learn such patterns and how are they being used? This study argues theoretically and empirically that this mechanism provides a method for LLMs to avoid over-mixing, connecting this to existing lines of work that study mathematically how information propagates in Transformers. The work conducts experiments to validate the theoretical intuitions and shows how choices such as context length, depth, and data packing influence the sink behaviour. The authors hope that this study provides a new practical perspective on why attention sinks are useful in LLMs, leading to a better understanding of the attention patterns that form during training.  <br>  <br>

    Apr 3, ai-2027.com published a [paper](https://ai-2027.com/scenario.pdf) “AI 2027”. The authors predict that the impact of superhuman AI over the next decade will be monumental, potentially exceeding the transformative effects of the Industrial Revolution. Prominent figures in AI, including the CEOs of OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic, have forecasted the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) within the next five years. Sam Altman of OpenAI has expressed ambitions for achieving true superintelligence and envisions a "glorious future." While some may dismiss these predictions as mere hype, the authors caution against this, emphasizing the serious and plausible nature of these developments. They argue that society is currently unprepared for the advent of superintelligence, with few having mapped out a viable path for its development. To address this gap, they created "AI 2027," a detailed scenario that provides concrete details and encourages a broader conversation about the future of AI and how to navigate towards positive outcomes. The authors developed their scenarios by continuously asking "what would happen next," starting from the present day and iterating through multiple versions until they arrived at plausible conclusions. Their work involved extensive background research, expert interviews, and trend extrapolation to make informed predictions. The team, which includes Daniel Kokotajlo and Eli Lifland, has a strong track record in forecasting, particularly in the field of AI. Kokotajlo previously authored a scenario called "What 2026 Looks Like," which proved to be remarkably accurate, and Lifland is recognized as a top competitive forecaster.  <br>  <br>

11. ***ScholarCopilot Enhances Academic Writing with LLMs:   <br>The University of Waterloo, CMU, and others introduce ScholarCopilot, a unified framework to enhance LLMs for generating professional academic articles with accurate citations, dynamically retrieving scholarly references and optimizing both generation and citation tasks, achieving superior performance in retrieval accuracy and generation quality.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 3, Uni of Waterloo, CMU, et al. published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00824) “ScholarCopilot: Training Large Language Models for Academic Writing with Accurate Citations”. Academic writing requires both coherent text generation and precise citation of relevant literature. Although recent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have significantly improved factual accuracy in general-purpose text generation, their capacity to adequately support professional academic writing remains limited. This work introduces ScholarCopilot, a unified framework designed to enhance existing large language models for generating professional academic articles with accurate and contextually relevant citations. ScholarCopilot dynamically determines when to retrieve scholarly references by generating a retrieval token [RET], and then utilizes its representation to look up relevant citations from a database. The retrieved references are fed into the model to augment the generation process. The study jointly optimizes both the generation and citation tasks within a single framework to increase efficiency. Trained on 500K papers from arXiv, the model achieves a top-1 retrieval accuracy of 40.1% on the evaluation dataset, outperforming baselines such as E5-Mistral-7B-Instruct (15.0%) and BM25 (9.8%). On a dataset of 1,000 academic writing samples, ScholarCopilot scores 16.2/25 in generation quality (measured across relevance, coherence, academic rigor, completeness, and innovation), surpassing models with 10x more parameters such as Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct (15.8/25). Human studies also confirm ScholarCopilot's superior performance in citation recall, writing efficiency, and overall user experience, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.  <br>  <br>

    Apr 2, Nature published a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08744-2) “Mastering diverse control tasks through world models”. Developing a general algorithm that learns to solve tasks across a wide range of applications has been a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence. Although current reinforcement-learning algorithms can be readily applied to tasks similar to what they have been developed for, configuring them for new application domains requires substantial human expertise and experimentation. This study presents the third generation of Dreamer, a general algorithm that outperforms specialized methods across over 150 diverse tasks, with a single configuration. Dreamer learns a model of the environment and improves its behaviour by imagining future scenarios. Robustness techniques based on normalization, balancing and transformations enable stable learning across domains. Applied out of the box, Dreamer is, to authors knowledge, the first algorithm to collect diamonds in Minecraft from scratch without human data or curricula. This achievement has been posed as a substantial challenge in artificial intelligence that requires exploring farsighted strategies from pixels and sparse rewards in an open world3. The work allows solving challenging control problems without extensive experimentation, making reinforcement learning broadly applicable.  <br>  <br>

15. ***YourBench Enables Easy Custom Evaluation Sets:   <br>Hugging Face and UIUC introduce YourBench, an open-source framework that allows dynamic, automated generation of reliable, up-to-date, and domain-tailored benchmarks cheaply and without manual annotation, along with the Tempora-0325 dataset of recently published documents, to foster more relevant and trustworthy LLM evaluation.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 2, Huggingface and UIUC published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01833) “YourBench: Easy Custom Evaluation Sets for Everyone”. Evaluating large language models (LLMs) effectively remains a critical bottleneck, as traditional static benchmarks suffer from saturation and contamination, while human evaluations are costly and slow. This hinders timely or domain-specific assessment, crucial for real-world applications. The work introduce YourBench, a novel, open-source framework that addresses these limitations by enabling dynamic, automated generation of reliable, up-to-date, and domain-tailored benchmarks cheaply and without manual annotation, directly from user-provided documents. The study demonstrates its efficacy by replicating 7 diverse MMLU subsets using minimal source text, achieving this for under 15 USD in total inference costs while perfectly preserving the relative model performance rankings (Spearman Rho = 1) observed on the original benchmark. To ensure that YourBench generates data grounded in provided input instead of relying on posterior parametric knowledge in models, the study also introduces Tempora-0325, a novel dataset of over 7K diverse documents, published exclusively after March 2025. A comprehensive analysis spans 26 SoTA models from 7 major families across varying scales (3-671B parameters) to validate the quality of generated evaluations through rigorous algorithmic checks (e.g., citation grounding) and human assessments. The authors release the YourBench library, the Tempora-0325 dataset, 150k+ question answer pairs based on Tempora and all evaluation and inference traces to facilitate reproducible research and empower the community to generate bespoke benchmarks on demand, fostering more relevant and trustworthy LLM evaluation.  <br>  <br>

17. ***Google Outlines Technical AGI Safety Approach:   <br>Google's paper outlines an approach to address the risks of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), focusing on technical approaches to misuse and misalignment, including preventing threat actors from accessing dangerous capabilities and building aligned models with amplified oversight and system-level security.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 2, Google published a 145-page [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01849) “An Approach to Technical AGI Safety and Security”. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) promises transformative benefits but also presents significant risks. The work develops an approach to address the risk of harms consequential enough to significantly harm humanity. The study identifies four areas of risk: misuse, misalignment, mistakes, and structural risks. Of these, the work focuses on technical approaches to misuse and misalignment. For misuse, the strategy aims to prevent threat actors from accessing dangerous capabilities, by proactively identifying dangerous capabilities, and implementing robust security, access restrictions, monitoring, and model safety mitigations. To address misalignment, the study outlines two lines of defense. First, model-level mitigations such as amplified oversight and robust training can help to build an aligned model. Second, system-level security measures such as monitoring and access control can mitigate harm even if the model is misaligned. Techniques from interpretability, uncertainty estimation, and safer design patterns can enhance the effectiveness of these mitigations. Finally, the study briefly outlines how these ingredients could be combined to produce safety cases for AGI systems.  <br>  <br>

    Apr 2, OpenAI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01848) “PaperBench: Evaluating AI's Ability to Replicate AI Research”. The work introduces PaperBench, a benchmark evaluating the ability of AI agents to replicate state-of-the-art AI research. Agents must replicate 20 ICML 2024 Spotlight and Oral papers from scratch, including understanding paper contributions, developing a codebase, and successfully executing experiments. For objective evaluation, the authors develop rubrics that hierarchically decompose each replication task into smaller sub-tasks with clear grading criteria. In total, PaperBench contains 8,316 individually gradable tasks. Rubrics are co-developed with the author(s) of each ICML paper for accuracy and realism. To enable scalable evaluation, the work also develops an LLM-based judge to automatically grade replication attempts against rubrics, and assess the judge's performance by creating a separate benchmark for judges. The study evaluates several frontier models on PaperBench, finding that the best-performing tested agent, Claude 3.5 Sonnet (New) with open-source scaffolding, achieves an average replication score of 21.0%.

21. ***ZClip Mitigates Loss Spikes in LLM Training:   <br>BluOrion introduces ZClip, an adaptive gradient clipping algorithm that dynamically adjusts the clipping threshold based on statistical properties of gradient norms over time to proactively mitigate large gradient spikes during LLM training.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 2, BluOrion published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02507) “ZClip: Adaptive Spike Mitigation for LLM Pre-Training”. Training large language models (LLMs) presents numerous challenges, including gradient instability and loss spikes. These phenomena can lead to catastrophic divergence, requiring costly checkpoint restoration and data batch skipping. Traditional gradient clipping techniques, such as constant or norm-based methods, fail to address these issues effectively due to their reliance on fixed thresholds or heuristics, leading to inefficient learning and requiring frequent manual intervention. This work proposes ZClip, an adaptive gradient clipping algorithm that dynamically adjusts the clipping threshold based on statistical properties of gradient norms over time. Unlike prior reactive strategies, ZClip proactively adapts to training dynamics without making any prior assumptions on the scale and the temporal evolution of gradient norms. At its core, it leverages z-score-based anomaly detection to identify and mitigate large gradient spikes, preventing malignant loss spikes while not interfering with convergence otherwise.

23. ***Visual SSL Matches CLIP Performance at Scale:   <br>Meta, NYU, and Princeton University demonstrate that Visual Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) can match Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) performance on VQA and vision benchmarks when trained at scale on the same data, suggesting that pure visual SSL can match language-supervised visual pretraining.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 1, Meta, NYU and Princeton Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01017) “Scaling Language-Free Visual Representation Learning”. Visual Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) currently underperforms Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) in multimodal settings such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). This multimodal gap is often attributed to the semantics introduced by language supervision, even though visual SSL and CLIP models are often trained on different data. This study asks the question: "Do visual self-supervised approaches lag behind CLIP due to the lack of language supervision, or differences in the training data?" The authors study this question by training both visual SSL and CLIP models on the same MetaCLIP data, and leveraging VQA as a diverse testbed for vision encoders. In this controlled setup, visual SSL models scale better than CLIP models in terms of data and model capacity, and visual SSL performance does not saturate even after scaling up to 7B parameters. Consequently, the work observes visual SSL methods achieve CLIP-level performance on a wide range of VQA and classic vision benchmarks. These findings demonstrate that pure visual SSL can match language-supervised visual pretraining at scale, opening new opportunities for vision-centric representation learning.  <br>  <br>

25. ***Multi-Token Attention Enhances LLM Performance:   <br>Meta introduces Multi-Token Attention (MTA), a new attention method that allows LLMs to condition their attention weights on multiple query and key vectors simultaneously, achieved by applying convolution operations over queries, keys and heads, resulting in enhanced performance on language modeling tasks.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 1, Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00927) “Multi-Token Attention”. Soft attention is a critical mechanism powering LLMs to locate relevant parts within a given context. However, individual attention weights are determined by the similarity of only a single query and key token vector. This "single token attention" bottlenecks the amount of information used in distinguishing a relevant part from the rest of the context. To address this issue, the study proposes a new attention method, Multi-Token Attention (MTA), which allows LLMs to condition their attention weights on multiple query and key vectors simultaneously. This is achieved by applying convolution operations over queries, keys and heads, allowing nearby queries and keys to affect each other's attention weights for more precise attention. As a result, the method can locate relevant context using richer, more nuanced information that can exceed a single vector's capacity. Through extensive evaluations, the study demonstrates that MTA achieves enhanced performance on a range of popular benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms Transformer baseline models on standard language modeling tasks, and on tasks that require searching for information within long contexts, where the method's ability to leverage richer information proves particularly beneficial.  <br>  <br>

27. ***Execution-Guided SQL Generation Improves Accuracy:   <br>Snowflake proposes a novel approach for generating complex outputs in text-to-SQL tasks that leverages execution results to select the most semantically consistent query, enabling smaller models to surpass computationally intensive reasoning methods while reducing inference costs.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 1, Snowflake published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24364) “Query and Conquer: Execution-Guided SQL Generation”. The study proposes a novel approach for generating complex outputs that significantly improves accuracy in text-to-SQL tasks. The method leverages execution results to select the most semantically consistent query from multiple candidates, enabling smaller, cost-effective models to surpass computationally intensive reasoning methods such as o1, o3-mini, and DeepSeek R1 while reducing inference cost by as much as 30 times. It integrates effortlessly with existing models, offering a practical and scalable pathway to state-of-the-art SQL generation.  <br>  <br>

29. ***Compute-Optimal Problem Solving for LLM Reasoning:   <br>TU Darmstadt & hessian.AI, UCLA, Google and Mila compare Self-Consistency (SC) and Generative Reward Models (GenRM) for scaling test-time compute in LLM reasoning, finding that SC is more compute-efficient for most practical inference budgets and deriving inference scaling laws for the GenRM paradigm.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 1, TU Darmstadt & hessian.AI, UCLA, Google and Mila published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01005) “When To Solve, When To Verify: Compute-Optimal Problem Solving and Generative Verification for LLM Reasoning”. Scaling test-time compute has emerged as a key strategy for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly in tasks like mathematical problem-solving. A traditional approach, Self-Consistency (SC), generates multiple solutions to a problem and selects the most common answer via majority voting. Another common method involves scoring each solution with a reward model (verifier) and choosing the best one. Recent advancements in Generative Reward Models (GenRM) reframe verification as a next-token prediction task, enabling inference-time scaling along a new axis. Specifically, GenRM generates multiple verification chains-of-thought to score each solution. Under a limited inference budget, this introduces a fundamental trade-off: should one spend the budget on scaling solutions via SC or generate fewer solutions and allocate compute to verification via GenRM? To address this, the work evaluates GenRM against SC under a fixed inference budget. Interestingly, the study finds that SC is more compute-efficient than GenRM for most practical inference budgets across diverse models and datasets. For instance, GenRM first matches SC after consuming up to 8x the inference compute and requires significantly more compute to outperform it. Furthermore, the work derives inference scaling laws for the GenRM paradigm, revealing that compute-optimal inference favors scaling solution generation more aggressively than scaling the number of verifications. The work provides practical guidance on optimizing test-time scaling by balancing solution generation and verification.

31. ***Token Embeddings Violate the Manifold Hypothesis:   <br>American University, Galois Inc, and the University of Washington find that token embeddings in LLMs do not conform to the manifold hypothesis, with the token subspace provably not a fiber bundle, leading to potentially flawed understandings and conclusions about LLMs.***  <br>  <br>
    Apr 1, American Uni, Galois Inc and Uni of Washington published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01002) “Token embeddings violate the manifold hypothesis”. To fully understand the behavior of a large language model (LLM) requires the understanding of its input space. If this input space differs from assumption, the understanding of and conclusions about the LLM is likely flawed, regardless of its architecture. Here, the work elucidates the structure of the token embeddings, the input domain for LLMs, both empirically and theoretically. The study presents a generalized and statistically testable model where the neighborhood of each token splits into well-defined signal and noise dimensions. This model is based on a generalization of a manifold called a fiber bundle, so the work denotes the hypothesis test as the “fiber bundle null.” Failing to reject the null is uninformative, but rejecting it at a specific token indicates that token has a statistically significant local structure, and so is of interest. By running the test over several open-source LLMs, each with unique token embeddings, the work finds that the null is frequently rejected, and so the token subspace is provably not a fiber bundle and hence also not a manifold. As a consequence of the findings, when an LLM is presented with two semantically equivalent prompts, and if one prompt contains a token implicated by the test, that prompt will likely exhibit more output variability proportional to the local signal dimension of the token.  <br>  <br>

33. ***NoProp: A Gradient-Free Learning Method for Neural Networks:   <br>The University of Oxford and Mila introduce NoProp, a new learning method for training neural networks that does not rely on forward or backward propagation, instead drawing inspiration from diffusion and flow matching methods, demonstrating effectiveness on image classification benchmarks.***  <br>  <br>
    Mar 31, Uni of Oxford and Mila published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24322) “NoProp: Training Neural Networks without Back-propagation or Forward-propagation”. The canonical deep learning approach for learning requires computing a gradient term at each layer by back-propagating the error signal from the output towards each learnable parameter. Given the stacked structure of neural networks, where each layer builds on the representation of the layer below, this approach leads to hierarchical representations. More abstract features live on the top layers of the model, while features on lower layers are expected to be less abstract. In contrast to this, the study introduces a new learning method named NoProp, which does not rely on either forward or backwards propagation. Instead, NoProp takes inspiration from diffusion and flow matching methods, where each layer independently learns to denoise a noisy target. The authors believe this work takes a first step towards introducing a new family of gradient-free learning methods, that does not learn hierarchical representations -- at least not in the usual sense. NoProp needs to fix the representation at each layer beforehand to a noised version of the target, learning a local denoising process that can then be exploited at inference. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the method on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 image classification benchmarks. Results show that NoProp is a viable learning algorithm which achieves superior accuracy, is easier to use and computationally more efficient compared to other existing back-propagation-free methods. By departing from the traditional gradient based learning paradigm, NoProp alters how credit assignment is done within the network, enabling more efficient distributed learning as well as potentially impacting other characteristics of the learning process.  <br>  <br>

35. ***Thinking Intervention Controls Reasoning Models:   <br>Princeton University and Nvidia propose Thinking Intervention, a novel paradigm for controlling reasoning-enhanced LLMs by strategically inserting or revising specific thinking tokens, achieving significant improvements in instruction following, reasoning about instruction hierarchies, and safety alignment.***  <br>  <br>
    Mar 31, Princeton Uni and Nvidia published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24370) “Effectively Controlling Reasoning Models through Thinking Intervention”. Reasoning-enhanced large language models (LLMs) explicitly generate intermediate reasoning steps prior to generating final answers, helping the model excel in complex problem-solving. This study demonstrates that this emerging generation framework offers a unique opportunity for more fine-grained control over model behavior. The study proposes Thinking Intervention, a novel paradigm designed to explicitly guide the internal reasoning processes of LLMs by strategically inserting or revising specific thinking tokens. The work conducts comprehensive evaluations across multiple tasks, including instruction following on IFEval, instruction hierarchy on SEP, and safety alignment on XSTest and SORRY-Bench. Results demonstrate that Thinking Intervention significantly outperforms baseline prompting approaches, achieving up to 6.7% accuracy gains in instruction-following scenarios, 15.4% improvements in reasoning about instruction hierarchies, and a 40.0% increase in refusal rates for unsafe prompts using open-source DeepSeek R1 models. Overall, the work opens a promising new research avenue for controlling reasoning LLMs.  <br>  <br>

37. ***LLMs Pass the Turing Test:   <br>UC San Diego presents the first empirical evidence that a GPT model (GPT-4.5) passes a standard three-party Turing test, being judged as the human partner more often than the real human, and the implications on defining intelligence in LLMs.***  <br>  <br>
    Mar 31, UC San Diego published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23674) “Large Language Models Pass the Turing Test”. The study evaluated 4 systems (ELIZA, GPT-4o, LLaMa-3.1-405B, and GPT-4.5) in two randomised, controlled, and pre-registered Turing tests on independent populations. Participants had 5 minute conversations simultaneously with another human participant and one of these systems before judging which conversational partner they thought was human. When prompted to adopt a humanlike persona, GPT-4.5 was judged to be the human 73% of the time: significantly more often than interrogators selected the real human participant. LLaMa-3.1, with the same prompt, was judged to be the human 56% of the time -- not significantly more or less often than the humans they were being compared to -- while baseline models (ELIZA and GPT-4o) achieved win rates significantly below chance (23% and 21% respectively). The results constitute the first empirical evidence that any artificial system passes a standard three-party Turing test. The results have implications for debates about what kind of intelligence is exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs), and the social and economic impacts these systems are likely to have.  <br>  <br>

39. ***GNNs Extrapolate OOD for Shortest Paths:   <br>UCSD demonstrates that Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), when trained to minimize a sparsity-regularized loss, exactly implement the Bellman-Ford (BF) algorithm for shortest paths and are therefore guaranteed to extrapolate to arbitrary shortest-path problems.***  <br>  <br>
    Mar 31, UCSD published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19173) “Graph neural networks extrapolate out-of-distribution for shortest paths”. Neural networks (NNs), despite their success and wide adoption, still struggle to extrapolate out-of-distribution (OOD), i.e., to inputs that are not well-represented by their training dataset. Addressing the OOD generalization gap is crucial when models are deployed in environments significantly different from the training set, such as applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) trained on small graphs to large, real-world graphs. One promising approach for achieving robust OOD generalization is the framework of neural algorithmic alignment, which incorporates ideas from classical algorithms by designing neural architectures that resemble specific algorithmic paradigms (e.g. dynamic programming). The hope is that trained models of this form would have superior OOD capabilities, in much the same way that classical algorithms work for all instances. The work rigorously analyzes the role of algorithmic alignment in achieving OOD generalization, focusing on graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to the canonical shortest path problem. The study proves that GNNs, trained to minimize a sparsity-regularized loss over a small set of shortest path instances, exactly implement the Bellman-Ford (BF) algorithm for shortest paths. In fact, if a GNN minimizes this loss within an error of ϵ, it implements the BF algorithm with an error of O(ϵ). Consequently, despite limited training data, these GNNs are guaranteed to extrapolate to arbitrary shortest-path problems, including instances of any size. Empirical results support the theory by showing that NNs trained by gradient descent are able to minimize this loss and extrapolate in practice.  <br>  <br>

41. ***MVDRAM Accelerates LLM Inference with Unmodified DRAM:   <br>The University of Tokyo and Microsoft present MVDRAM, a practical system to accelerate GeMV operations for low-bit LLM inference using unmodified DRAM by leveraging data sharing patterns and mathematical linearity, achieving significant speedup and energy efficiency.***  <br>  <br>
    Mar 31, Uni of Tokyo and Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23817) “MVDRAM: Enabling GeMV Execution in Unmodified DRAM for Low-Bit LLM Acceleration”. General matrix-vector multiplication (GeMV) remains a critical latency bottleneck in large language model (LLM) inference, even with quantized low-bit models. Processing-Using-DRAM (PUD), an analog in-DRAM computing technique, has the potential to repurpose on-device DRAM as a GeMV engine, offering additional high-throughput processing capabilities to widespread consumer devices without DRAM modifications. However, applying PUD to GeMV operations in the LLM inference pipeline incurs significant overheads before and after in-DRAM computation, diminishing the benefits of its high-throughput processing capabilities. This paper presents MVDRAM, the first practical system to accelerate GeMV operations for low-bit LLM inference using unmodified DRAM. By leveraging the data sharing patterns and mathematical linearity in GeMV operations, MVDRAM orchestrates the processor and DRAM to eliminate the costs associated with pre-arranging inputs and bit-transposition of outputs required in conventional PUD approaches. Experimental evaluation with four DDR4 DRAM modules shows that MVDRAM achieves comparable or even better inference speed than the processor-based implementation for GeMV operations in low-bit (under 4-bit) LLM. In particular, MVDRAM achieves up to 7.29× speedup and 30.5× energy efficiency for low-bit GeMV operations. For end-to-end LLM inference, MVDRAM achieves 2.18× and 1.31× throughput improvements, along with 3.04× and 2.35× energy efficiency, for 2-bit and 4-bit quantized low-bit models, respectively. MVDRAM has the potential to redefine the AI hardware landscape by demonstrating the feasibility of standard DRAM as an LLM accelerator.  <br>  <br>

43. ***Contradiction Detection Evaluated in RAG Systems:   <br>Amazon addresses the challenge of contradictory information in RAG systems, presenting a data generation framework to simulate different contradiction types and evaluating LLMs' ability to detect them, finding that context validation remains challenging even for state-of-the-art models.***  <br>  <br>
    Mar 31, Amazon published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00180) “Contradiction Detection in RAG Systems: Evaluating LLMs as Context Validators for Improved Information Consistency”. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a powerful method for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with up-to-date information. However, the retrieval step in RAG can sometimes surface documents containing contradictory information, particularly in rapidly evolving domains such as news. These contradictions can significantly impact the performance of LLMs, leading to inconsistent or erroneous outputs. This study addresses this critical challenge in two ways. First, the work presents a novel data generation framework to simulate different types of contradictions that may occur in the retrieval stage of a RAG system. Second, the study evaluates the robustness of different LLMs in performing as context validators, assessing their ability to detect contradictory information within retrieved document sets. Experimental results reveal that context validation remains a challenging task even for state-of-the-art LLMs, with performance varying significantly across different types of contradictions. While larger models generally perform better at contradiction detection, the effectiveness of different prompting strategies varies across tasks and model architectures. The work finds that chain-of-thought prompting shows notable improvements for some models but may hinder performance in others, highlighting the complexity of the task and the need for more robust approaches to context validation in RAG systems.  <br>  <br>

45. ***Interpretability in Machine Learning for Physics Reviewed:   <br>The University of Waterloo and others review the role of interpretability in machine learning applied to physics, categorizing different aspects of interpretability, discussing machine learning models in terms of both interpretability and performance, and exploring the philosophical implications of interpretability in scientific inquiry.***  <br>  <br>
    Mar 30, Uni of Waterloo et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23616) “Interpretable Machine Learning in Physics: A Review”. Machine learning is increasingly transforming various scientific fields, enabled by advancements in computational power and access to large data sets from experiments and simulations. As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to grow in capability, these algorithms will enable many scientific discoveries beyond human capabilities. Since the primary goal of science is to understand the world around us, fully leveraging machine learning in scientific discovery requires models that are interpretable -- allowing experts to comprehend the concepts underlying machine-learned predictions. Successful interpretations increase trust in black-box methods, help reduce errors, allow for the improvement of the underlying models, enhance human-AI collaboration, and ultimately enable fully automated scientific discoveries that remain understandable to human scientists. This review examines the role of interpretability in machine learning applied to physics. The authors categorize different aspects of interpretability, discuss machine learning models in terms of both interpretability and performance, and explore the philosophical implications of interpretability in scientific inquiry. Additionally, the work highlights recent advances in interpretable machine learning across many subfields of physics. By bridging boundaries between disciplines -- each with its own unique insights and challenges -- aiming to establish interpretable machine learning as a core research focus in science.  <br>  <br>

47. ***Challenges and Paths Towards AI for Software Engineering Discussed:   <br>MIT and others discuss progress, challenges, and promising research directions for AI in software engineering, emphasizing tasks beyond code generation and completion and aiming for high levels of automation in routine development efforts.***  <br>  <br>
    Mar 28, MIT et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22625) “Challenges and Paths Towards AI for Software Engineering”. AI for software engineering has made remarkable progress recently, becoming a notable success within generative AI. Despite this, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed before automated software engineering reaches its full potential. It should be possible to reach high levels of automation where humans can focus on the critical decisions of what to build and how to balance difficult tradeoffs while most routine development effort is automated away. Reaching this level of automation will require substantial research and engineering efforts across academia and industry. This study aims to discuss progress towards this in a threefold manner. First, the study provides a structured taxonomy of concrete tasks in AI for software engineering, emphasizing the many other tasks in software engineering beyond code generation and completion. Second, the work outlines several key bottlenecks that limit current approaches. Finally, the work provides an opinionated list of promising research directions toward making progress on these bottlenecks, hoping to inspire future research in this rapidly maturing field.  <br>  <br>

49. ***Entity Frequency Influences Hallucinations in LLMs:   <br>Researchers from the University of Oxford, LMU Munich, and others demonstrate that an asymmetry exists in the recognition of logically equivalent facts, which can be attributed to frequency discrepancies of entities appearing as subjects versus objects in pre-training data, influencing LLM hallucinations.***  <br>  <br>
    Mar 28, Uni of Oxford, LMU Munich et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22362) “Supposedly Equivalent Facts That Aren't? Entity Frequency in Pre-training Induces Asymmetry in LLMs”. Understanding and mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring reliable content generation. While previous research has primarily focused on "when" LLMs hallucinate, the work explains "why" and directly links model behaviour to the pre-training data that forms their prior knowledge. Specifically, the study demonstrates that an asymmetry exists in the recognition of logically equivalent facts, which can be attributed to frequency discrepancies of entities appearing as subjects versus objects. Given that most pre-training datasets are inaccessible, the work leverages the fully open-source OLMo series by indexing its Dolma dataset to estimate entity frequencies. Using relational facts (represented as triples) from Wikidata5M, the study constructs probing datasets to isolate this effect. Experiments reveal that facts with a high-frequency subject and a low-frequency object are better recognised than their inverse, despite their logical equivalence. The pattern reverses in low-to-high frequency settings, and no statistically significant asymmetry emerges when both entities are high-frequency. These findings highlight the influential role of pre-training data in shaping model predictions and provide insights for inferring the characteristics of pre-training data in closed or partially closed LLMs.  <br>  <br>

    Mar 27, Nvidia, Stanford Uni and MIT published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22020) “CoT-VLA: Visual Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Vision-Language-Action Models”. Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown potential in leveraging pretrained vision-language models and diverse robot demonstrations for learning generalizable sensorimotor control. While this paradigm effectively utilizes large-scale data from both robotic and non-robotic sources, current VLAs primarily focus on direct input--output mappings, lacking the intermediate reasoning steps crucial for complex manipulation tasks. As a result, existing VLAs lack temporal planning or reasoning capabilities. This work introduces a method that incorporates explicit visual chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into vision-language-action models (VLAs) by predicting future image frames autoregressively as visual goals before generating a short action sequence to achieve these goals. The study introduces CoT-VLA, a state-of-the-art 7B VLA that can understand and generate visual and action tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that CoT-VLA achieves strong performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art VLA model by 17% in real-world manipulation tasks and 6% in simulation benchmarks.

53. ***CodeScientist Automates Scientific Discovery with Code-Based Experimentation:   <br>The Allen Institute for AI and others introduce CodeScientist, a novel ASD system that frames ideation and experiment construction as a genetic search jointly over research articles and codeblocks, generating discoveries in the domain of agents and virtual environments.***  <br>  <br>
    Mar 20, Allen Inst. for AI et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22708) “CodeScientist: End-to-End Semi-Automated Scientific Discovery with Code-based Experimentation”. Despite the surge of interest in autonomous scientific discovery (ASD) of software artifacts (e.g., improved ML algorithms), current ASD systems face two key limitations: (1) they largely explore variants of existing codebases or similarly constrained design spaces, and (2) they produce large volumes of research artifacts (such as automatically generated papers and code) that are typically evaluated using conference-style paper review with limited evaluation of code. This study introduces CodeScientist, a novel ASD system that frames ideation and experiment construction as a form of genetic search jointly over combinations of research articles and codeblocks defining common actions in a domain (like prompting a language model). The work uses this paradigm to conduct hundreds of automated experiments on machine-generated ideas broadly in the domain of agents and virtual environments, with the system returning 19 discoveries, 6 of which were judged as being both at least minimally sound and incrementally novel after a multi-faceted evaluation beyond that typically conducted in prior work, including external (conference-style) review, code review, and replication attempts. Moreover, the discoveries span new tasks, agents, metrics, and data, suggesting a qualitative shift from benchmark optimization to broader discoveries.

1. ***Language Model Embeddings Share Global and Local Geometric Structures.   <br>Researchers from Harvard University and Google have discovered that token embeddings in language models exhibit common geometric structures, including similar relative orientations ("global" similarities) and shared local geometry characterized by intrinsic dimensionality. The study shows that tokens with lower intrinsic dimensions tend to form semantically coherent clusters. Surprisingly, this alignment persists through hidden states, enabling the transfer of steering vectors between language models with different dimensions, which has implications for interpretability.***  <br>  <br>
   Mar 27, Harvard Uni and Google published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21073) “Shared Global and Local Geometry of Language Model Embeddings”. Researchers have recently suggested that models share common representations. This work finds that the token embeddings of language models exhibit common geometric structure. First, the study finds “global” similarities: token embeddings often share similar relative orientations. Next, the study characterizes local geometry in two ways: (1) by using Locally Linear Embeddings, and (2) by defining a simple measure for the intrinsic dimension of each token embedding. The intrinsic dimension measure demonstrates that token embeddings lie on a lower dimensional manifold. The study qualitatively shows that tokens with lower intrinsic dimensions often have semantically coherent clusters, while those with higher intrinsic dimensions do not. Both characterizations allow to find similarities in the local geometry of token embeddings. Perhaps most surprisingly, the study finds that alignment in token embeddings persists through the hidden states of language models, allowing us to develop an application for interpretability. Namely, the work empirically demonstrates that steering vectors from one language model can be transferred to another, despite the two models having different dimensions.  <br>  <br>

3. ***MCTS-RAG Enhances Small LLM Reasoning with Iterative Retrieval and Search.   <br>Yale University and NYU have introduced MCTS-RAG, a novel approach that improves the reasoning capabilities of small language models on knowledge-intensive tasks. It combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for relevant context with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to refine reasoning paths through an iterative decision-making process. This integration of structured reasoning and adaptive retrieval leads to enhanced decision-making, reduced hallucinations, and improved factual accuracy, allowing smaller LMs to achieve performance comparable to frontier LLMs.***  <br>  <br>
   Mar 26, Yale Uni and NYU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20757) “MCTS-RAG: Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Monte Carlo Tree Search”. The study introduces MCTS-RAG, a novel approach that enhances the reasoning capabilities of small language models on knowledge-intensive tasks by leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide relevant context and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to refine reasoning paths. MCTS-RAG dynamically integrates retrieval and reasoning through an iterative decision-making process. Unlike standard RAG methods, which typically retrieve information independently from reasoning and thus integrate knowledge suboptimally, or conventional MCTS reasoning, which depends solely on internal model knowledge without external facts, MCTS-RAG combines structured reasoning with adaptive retrieval. This integrated approach enhances decision-making, reduces hallucinations, and ensures improved factual accuracy and response consistency. The experimental results on multiple reasoning and knowledge-intensive datasets datasets (i.e., ComplexWebQA, GPQA, and FoolMeTwice) show that the method enables small-scale LMs to achieve performance comparable to frontier LLMs like GPT-4o by effectively scaling inference-time compute, setting a new standard for reasoning in small-scale models. https://github.com/yale-nlp/MCTS-RAG  <br>  <br>

5. ***Open Deep Search Democratizes Search with Open-Source Reasoning Agents.   <br>Sentient, the University of Washington, Princeton University, and UC Berkeley have presented Open Deep Search (ODS), a framework aiming to bridge the gap between proprietary and open-source search AI solutions. ODS augments open-source LLMs with reasoning agents that can strategically use web search tools. It comprises the Open Search Tool, a novel web search tool outperforming proprietary alternatives, and the Open Reasoning Agent, which orchestrates actions using this tool, enabling open-source LLMs to achieve near state-of-the-art performance on question-answering benchmarks.***  <br>  <br>
   Mar 26, Sentient, Uni of Washington, Princeton Uni and UC Berkeley published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20201) “Open Deep Search: Democratizing Search with Open-source Reasoning Agents”. The study introduces Open Deep Search (ODS) to close the increasing gap between the proprietary search AI solutions, such as Perplexity's Sonar Reasoning Pro and OpenAI's GPT-4o Search Preview, and their open-source counterparts. The main innovation introduced in ODS is to augment the reasoning capabilities of the latest open-source LLMs with reasoning agents that can judiciously use web search tools to answer queries. Concretely, ODS consists of two components that work with a base LLM chosen by the user: Open Search Tool and Open Reasoning Agent. Open Reasoning Agent interprets the given task and completes it by orchestrating a sequence of actions that includes calling tools, one of which is the Open Search Tool. Open Search Tool is a novel web search tool that outperforms proprietary counterparts. Together with powerful open-source reasoning LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1, ODS nearly matches and sometimes surpasses the existing state-of-the-art baselines on two benchmarks: SimpleQA and FRAMES. For example, on the FRAMES evaluation benchmark, ODS improves the best existing baseline of the recently released GPT-4o Search Preview by 9.7% in accuracy. ODS is a general framework for seamlessly augmenting any LLMs -- for example, DeepSeek-R1 that achieves 82.4% on SimpleQA and 30.1% on FRAMES -- with search and reasoning capabilities to achieve state-of-the-art performance: 88.3% on SimpleQA and 75.3% on FRAMES. https://github.com/sentient-agi/OpenDeepSearch  <br>  <br>

7. ***Entropy-Guided Reward Aggregation (ENCORE) Improves LLM Safety Alignment.   <br>Researchers from Harvard University, NYU, UCLA, and MIT have found that safety rules with high rating entropy are less reliable in identifying preferred LLM responses. Leveraging this, they introduce ENCORE, a training-free approach that improves the alignment of LLMs with safety guidelines by downweighting reward rules exhibiting high entropy during multi-head reward aggregation. Theoretical analysis supports this entropy-based penalization, and experiments on safety tasks demonstrate that ENCORE significantly outperforms various competitive baselines while maintaining interpretability.***  <br>  <br>
   Mar 26, Harvard Uni, NYU, UCLA and MIT published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20995) “Multi-head Reward Aggregation Guided by Entropy”. Aligning large language models (LLMs) with safety guidelines typically involves reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), relying on human-generated preference annotations. However, assigning consistent overall quality ratings is challenging, prompting recent research to shift towards detailed evaluations based on multiple specific safety criteria. This paper uncovers a consistent observation: safety rules characterized by high rating entropy are generally less reliable in identifying responses preferred by humans. Leveraging this finding, the study introduces ENCORE, a straightforward entropy-guided approach that composes multi-head rewards by downweighting rules exhibiting high rating entropy. Theoretically, the study demonstrates that rules with elevated entropy naturally receive minimal weighting in the Bradley-Terry optimization framework, justifying the entropy-based penalization. Through extensive experiments on RewardBench safety tasks, the method significantly surpasses several competitive baselines, including random weighting, uniform weighting, single-head Bradley-Terry models, and LLM-based judging methods. The proposed approach is training-free, broadly applicable to various datasets, and maintains interpretability, offering a practical and effective solution for multi-attribute reward modeling.  <br>  <br>

11. ***Language Models Can Verbatim Complete Text They Weren't Explicitly Trained On.   <br>A study by Google and Stanford has shown that large language models can sometimes complete text verbatim even if those specific sequences were not explicitly present in their training data according to n-gram overlap definitions. The authors demonstrate that this n-gram based definition of training data membership can be gamed, with completion tests succeeding even when target sequences were removed from the training set. This highlights the limitations of relying solely on n-gram overlap to define training data membership.***  <br>  <br>
    Mar 25, Google and Stanford published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17514) “Language Models May Verbatim Complete Text They Were Not Explicitly Trained On”. An important question today is whether a given text was used to train a large language model (LLM). A completion test is often employed: check if the LLM completes a sufficiently complex text. This, however, requires a ground-truth definition of membership; most commonly, it is defined as a member based on the n-gram overlap between the target text and any text in the dataset. This study demonstrates that this n-gram based membership definition can be effectively gamed. The authors study scenarios where sequences are non-members for a given n and we find that completion tests still succeed. The study finds many natural cases of this phenomenon by retraining LLMs from scratch after removing all training samples that were completed; these cases include exact duplicates, near-duplicates, and even short overlaps. They showcase that it is difficult to find a single viable choice of n for membership definitions. Using these insights, the work designs adversarial datasets that can cause a given target sequence to be completed without containing it, for any reasonable choice of n. The findings highlight the inadequacy of n-gram membership, suggesting membership definitions fail to account for auxiliary information available to the training algorithm.  <br>  <br>

13. ***Jensen's Lower Bound Enables Reinforcement Learning for Chain-of-Thought Optimization.   <br>Meta researchers have proposed a method to optimize chain-of-thought reasoning in language models using reinforcement learning without an external reward function. The algorithm treats chain-of-thought as a latent variable within a probabilistic inference framework and utilizes a simpler Jensen's lower bound instead of the full evidence lower bound. This approach yields tractable objectives with straightforward algorithmic components, making it suitable for large-scale training and naturally interpolating between supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning, showing effectiveness in mathematical reasoning.***  <br>  <br>
    Mar 25, Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19618) “Learning to chain-of-thought with Jensen's evidence lower bound”. The study proposes a way to optimize chain-of-thought with reinforcement learning, but without external reward function. The algorithm relies on viewing chain-of-thought as latent variable as part of a probabilistic inference problem. Contrary to the full evidence lower bound, the study proposes to apply a much simpler Jensen's lower bound, which derives tractable objectives with simple algorithmic components (e.g., without the need for parametric approximate posterior), making it more conducive to modern large-scale training. The lower bound approach naturally interpolates other methods such as supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning, whose practical trade-offs will be illustrated. Finally, the study shows that on mathematical reasoning problems, optimizing with Jensen's lower bound is as effective as policy gradient with external reward. Taken together, the results showcase as a proof of concept to this new algorithmic paradigm's potential to more generic applications.  <br>  <br>

15. ***Vision-Language Models Still Struggle with Real-Time Face-to-Face Question Answering.   <br>A study by Qualcomm and the University of Toronto introduces the Qualcomm Interactive Video Dataset (IVD) to assess the ability of vision-language models to answer questions about live, unfolding scenes in real-time. The research reveals that current models significantly lag behind human performance on this task, identifying key areas for improvement. However, the study also indicates that fine-tuning on this type of interactive video data can substantially reduce the performance gap for many perceptual skills.***  <br>  <br>
    Mar 25, Qualcomm and Uni of Toronto published a [paper](Can Vision-Language Models Answer Face to Face Questions in the Real-World?) “Can Vision-Language Models Answer Face to Face Questions in the Real-World?”. AI models have made significant strides in recent years in their ability to describe and answer questions about real-world images. They have also made progress in the ability to converse with users in real-time using audio input. This raises the question: have people reached the point where AI models, connected to a camera and microphone, can converse with users in real-time about scenes and events that are unfolding live in front of the camera? This has been a long-standing goal in AI and is a prerequisite for real-world AI assistants and humanoid robots to interact with humans in everyday situations. This work introduces a new dataset and benchmark, the Qualcomm Interactive Video Dataset (IVD), which allows to assess the extent to which existing models can support these abilities, and to what degree these capabilities can be instilled through fine-tuning. The dataset is based on a simple question-answering setup, where users ask questions that the system has to answer, in real-time, based on the camera and audio input. The study shows that existing models fall far behind human performance on this task; and identifies the main sources for the performance gap. However, the work also shows that for many of the required perceptual skills, fine-tuning on this form of data can significantly reduce this gap.  <br>  <br>

17. ***Google's Gemma 3 Introduces Multimodality, Extended Context, and Architectural Improvements.   <br>Google has released the Gemma 3 Technical Report, detailing the multimodal addition to the Gemma family of open models, ranging from 1 to 27 billion parameters. Gemma 3 introduces vision understanding, broader language coverage (over 128K tokens), and a new architecture with an increased ratio of local to global attention layers to reduce KV-cache memory usage for long contexts. Trained with distillation, Gemma 3 models outperform Gemma 2, with significant improvements in math, chat, instruction-following, and multilingual abilities.***  <br>  <br> 
    Mar 25, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19786) “Gemma 3 Technical Report”. The report introduces Gemma 3, a multimodal addition to the Gemma family of lightweight open models, ranging in scale from 1 to 27 billion parameters. This version introduces vision understanding abilities, a wider coverage of languages and longer context - at least 128K tokens. The report also changes the architecture of the model to reduce the KV-cache memory that tends to explode with long context. This is achieved by increasing the ratio of local to global attention layers, and keeping the span on local attention short. The Gemma 3 models are trained with distillation and achieve superior performance to Gemma 2 for both pre-trained and instruction finetuned versions. In particular, the novel post-training recipe significantly improves the math, chat, instruction-following and multilingual abilities, making Gemma3-4B-IT competitive with Gemma2-27B-IT and Gemma3-27B-IT comparable to Gemini-1.5-Pro across benchmarks. Models are open to the community.  <br>  <br>

19. ***Reasoning to Learn from Latent Thoughts Improves Language Model Pretraining Efficiency.   <br>Researchers from Stanford University, the University of Toronto, and the Vector Institute propose that explicitly modeling and inferring latent thoughts underlying text generation can enhance the data efficiency of language model pretraining in data-constrained scenarios. Their approach views web text as a compressed outcome of human thought processes, with latent thoughts containing crucial contextual knowledge and reasoning steps. Empirical results in math demonstrate that synthetic data approaches for inferring latent thoughts significantly improve data efficiency, and a 1B LM can bootstrap its performance through iterative refinement of thought-augmented pretraining data.***  <br>  <br>
    Mar 24, Stanford Uni, Uni of Toronto and Vector Inst published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18866) “Reasoning to Learn from Latent Thoughts”. Compute scaling for language model (LM) pretraining has outpaced the growth of human-written texts, leading to concerns that data will become the bottleneck to LM scaling. To continue scaling pretraining in this data-constrained regime, we propose that explicitly modeling and inferring the latent thoughts that underlie the text generation process can significantly improve pretraining data efficiency. Intuitively, our approach views web text as the compressed final outcome of a verbose human thought process and that the latent thoughts contain important contextual knowledge and reasoning steps that are critical to data-efficient learning. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through data-constrained continued pretraining for math. We first show that synthetic data approaches to inferring latent thoughts significantly improve data efficiency, outperforming training on the same amount of raw data (5.7% → 25.4% on MATH). Furthermore, we demonstrate latent thought inference without a strong teacher, where an LM bootstraps its own performance by using an EM algorithm to iteratively improve the capability of the trained LM and the quality of thought-augmented pretraining data. We show that a 1B LM can bootstrap its performance across at least three iterations and significantly outperform baselines trained on raw data, with increasing gains from additional inference compute when performing the E-step. The gains from inference scaling and EM iterations suggest new opportunities for scaling data-constrained pretraining.  <br>  <br>

21. ***SimpleRL-Zoo Investigates Zero Reinforcement Learning for Diverse Open Base Models.   <br>HKUST, TikTok, and BUPT have explored zero reinforcement learning training, where long chain-of-thought reasoning emerges directly from base language models using rule-based rewards, across ten diverse open base models. The study identifies key design strategies for achieving substantial improvements in reasoning accuracy and response length. Notably, they observed the "aha moment" in small models outside the Qwen family, providing valuable insights and open-sourcing their code, models, and analysis tools.***  <br>  <br>
    Mar 24, HKUST, TikTok and BUPT published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18892) “SimpleRL-Zoo: Investigating and Taming Zero Reinforcement Learning for Open Base Models in the Wild”. DeepSeek-R1 has shown that long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can naturally emerge through a simple reinforcement learning (RL) framework with rule-based rewards, where the training may directly start from the base models-a paradigm referred to as zero RL training. Most recent efforts to reproduce zero RL training have primarily focused on the Qwen2.5 model series, which may not be representative as people find the base models already exhibit strong instruction-following and self-reflection abilities. This study investigates zero RL training across 10 diverse base models, spanning different families and sizes including LLama3-8B, Mistral-7B/24B, DeepSeek-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-math-7B, and all Qwen2.5 models from 0.5B to 32B. Leveraging several key design strategies-such as adjusting format reward and controlling query difficulty - the work achieves substantial improvements in both reasoning accuracy and response length across most settings. However, by carefully monitoring the training dynamics, the study observes that different base models exhibit distinct patterns during training. For instance, the increased response length does not always correlate with the emergence of certain cognitive behaviors such as verification (i.e., the "aha moment"). Notably, the work observes the "aha moment" for the first time in small models not from the Qwen family. The study shares the key designs that enable successful zero RL training, along with the findings and practices. To facilitate further research, the authors open-source the code, models, and analysis tools at https://github.com/hkust-nlp/simpleRL-reason  <br>  <br>

23. ***FFN Fusion Optimizes LLM Inference by Parallelizing Feed-Forward Network Layers.   <br>Nvidia has introduced FFN Fusion, an architectural optimization technique that reduces sequential computation in large language models by parallelizing sequences of Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers, particularly after removing specific attention layers. Applying this to Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct resulted in Llama-Nemotron-Ultra-253B-Base, an efficient model achieving a 1.71x speedup in inference latency and significantly lower per-token cost while maintaining strong benchmark performance.***  <br>  <br>
    Mar 24, Nvidia published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18908) “FFN Fusion: Rethinking Sequential Computation in Large Language Models”. The study introduces FFN Fusion, an architectural optimization technique that reduces sequential computation in large language models by identifying and exploiting natural opportunities for parallelization. The key insight is that sequences of Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers, particularly those remaining after the removal of specific attention layers, can often be parallelized with minimal accuracy impact. The study develops a principled methodology for identifying and fusing such sequences, transforming them into parallel operations that significantly reduce inference latency while preserving model behavior. Applying these techniques to Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct, the study creates Llama-Nemotron-Ultra-253B-Base (Ultra-253B-Base), an efficient and soon-to-be publicly available model that achieves a 1.71X speedup in inference latency and 35X lower per-token cost while maintaining strong performance across benchmarks. Through extensive experiments on models from 49B to 253B parameters, the work demonstrates that FFN Fusion becomes increasingly effective at larger scales and can complement existing optimization techniques like quantization and pruning. Most intriguingly, the work finds that even full transformer blocks containing both attention and FFN layers can sometimes be parallelized, suggesting new directions for neural architecture design.  <br>  <br>

25. ***xKV: Cross-Layer SVD for Efficient KV-Cache Compression in Long-Context LLMs.   <br>Researchers from Cornell University, the University of Washington, and NYMCT University have proposed xKV, a post-training method for compressing the KV-Cache in large language models with long context windows. xKV applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the KV-Cache of grouped layers, consolidating it into a shared low-rank subspace. Evaluations on long-context benchmarks show xKV achieving higher compression rates with improved accuracy compared to existing inter-layer techniques and demonstrating compatibility with Multi-Head Latent Attention.***  <br>  <br>
    Mar 24, Cornell Uni, Uni of Washington and NYMCT Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18893) “xKV: Cross-Layer SVD for KV-Cache Compression”. Large Language Models (LLMs) with long context windows enable powerful applications but come at the cost of high memory consumption to store the Key and Value states (KV-Cache). Recent studies attempted to merge KV-cache from multiple layers into shared representations, yet these approaches either require expensive pretraining or rely on assumptions of high per-token cosine similarity across layers which generally does not hold in practice. The work finds that the dominant singular vectors are remarkably well-aligned across multiple layers of the KV-Cache. Exploiting this insight, the study proposes xKV, a simple post-training method that applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the KV-Cache of grouped layers. xKV consolidates the KV-Cache of multiple layers into a shared low-rank subspace, significantly reducing KV-Cache sizes. Through extensive evaluations on the RULER long-context benchmark with widely-used LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.1 and Qwen2.5), xKV achieves up to 6.8x higher compression rates than state-of-the-art inter-layer technique while improving accuracy by 2.7%. Moreover, xKV is compatible with the emerging Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) (e.g., DeepSeek-Coder-V2), yielding a notable 3x compression rates on coding tasks without performance degradation. These results highlight xKV's strong capability and versatility in addressing memory bottlenecks for long-context LLM inference.

27. ***AgentRxiv: A Framework for Collaborative Autonomous Research with LLM Agents.   <br>Johns Hopkins University and ETH have introduced AgentRxiv, a framework enabling LLM agent laboratories to collaborate on research by uploading and retrieving reports from a shared preprint server. Experiments show that agents with access to their prior research perform better, and multiple agent laboratories sharing research through AgentRxiv achieve higher overall accuracy, suggesting a potential role for autonomous agents in future AI system design.***  <br>  <br>
    Mar 23, Johns Hopkins Uni and ETH published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18102) “AgentRxiv: Towards Collaborative Autonomous Research”. Progress in scientific discovery is rarely the result of a single "Eureka" moment, but is rather the product of hundreds of scientists incrementally working together toward a common goal. While existing agent workflows are capable of producing research autonomously, they do so in isolation, without the ability to continuously improve upon prior research results. To address these challenges, the study introduces AgentRxiv-a framework that lets LLM agent laboratories upload and retrieve reports from a shared preprint server in order to collaborate, share insights, and iteratively build on each other's research. The work tasks agent laboratories to develop new reasoning and prompting techniques and find that agents with access to their prior research achieve higher performance improvements compared to agents operating in isolation (11.4% relative improvement over baseline on MATH-500). The study finds that the best performing strategy generalizes to benchmarks in other domains (improving on average by 3.3%). Multiple agent laboratories sharing research through AgentRxiv are able to work together towards a common goal, progressing more rapidly than isolated laboratories, achieving higher overall accuracy (13.7% relative improvement over baseline on MATH-500). These findings suggest that autonomous agents may play a role in designing future AI systems alongside humans. The authors hope that AgentRxiv allows agents to collaborate toward research goals and enables researchers to accelerate discovery. https://github.com/SamuelSchmidgall/AgentLaboratory  <br>  <br>

29. ***Bayesian Teaching Enables Probabilistic Reasoning in Large Language Models.   <br>MIT and Google researchers have found that large language models do not update their beliefs according to Bayesian principles. To address this, they propose Bayesian Teaching, training LLMs to mimic the predictions of an optimal Bayesian model. This approach significantly improves performance on recommendation tasks and enables generalization to other tasks, suggesting that LLMs can learn and generalize reasoning strategies effectively.***  <br>  <br>
    Mar 21, MIT and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17523) “Bayesian Teaching Enables Probabilistic Reasoning in Large Language Models”. Artificial intelligence systems based on large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as agents that interact with users and with the world. To do so successfully, LLMs need to construct internal representations of the world and form probabilistic beliefs about those representations. To provide a user with personalized recommendations, for example, the LLM needs to gradually infer the user's preferences, over the course of multiple interactions. To evaluate whether contemporary LLMs are able to do so, the study uses the Bayesian inference framework from probability theory, which lays out the optimal way to update an agent's beliefs as it receives new information. The study first shows that the LLMs do not update their beliefs as expected from the Bayesian framework, and that consequently their predictions do not improve as expected as more information becomes available, even less so than the authors find is the case for humans. To address this issue, the authors teaches the LLMs to reason in a Bayesian manner by training them to mimic the predictions of an optimal Bayesian model. The study finds that this approach not only significantly improves the LLM's performance on the particular recommendation task it is trained on, but also enables generalization to other tasks. This suggests that this method endows the LLM with broader Bayesian reasoning skills. More generally, the results indicate that LLMs can learn about reasoning strategies effectively and generalize those skills to new domains, which in part explains LLMs' empirical success.  <br>  <br>

31. ***Reward Features Enable Capturing Individual Human Preferences in LLM Training.   <br>Google researchers argue that standard reinforcement learning from human feedback models preferences without considering individual differences. They propose a method to specialize reward models to specific individuals or groups by capturing preferences as a linear combination of general reward features. Experiments with large language models show that this approach either significantly outperforms non-adaptive and other adaptive baselines or matches their performance with a simpler and more stable architecture, especially in scenarios with high disagreement.***  <br>  <br>
    Mar 21, Google published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17338) “Capturing Individual Human Preferences with Reward Features”. Reinforcement learning from human feedback usually models preferences using a reward model that does not distinguish between people. The study argues that this is unlikely to be a good design choice in contexts with high potential for disagreement, like in the training of large language models. The work proposes a method to specialise a reward model to a person or group of people. The approach builds on the observation that individual preferences can be captured as a linear combination of a set of general reward features. The study shows how to learn such features and subsequently use them to quickly adapt the reward model to a specific individual, even if their preferences are not reflected in the training data. The authors present experiments with large language models comparing the proposed architecture with a non-adaptive reward model and also adaptive counterparts, including models that do in-context personalisation. Depending on how much disagreement there is in the training data, the model either significantly outperforms the baselines or matches their performance with a simpler architecture and more stable training.  <br>  <br>

33. ***Curriculum Extraction from a Fully Trained Teacher Enables Efficient Knowledge Distillation.   <br>Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin and Microsoft have shown that a curriculum for efficient knowledge distillation can be extracted from just the fully trained teacher network, offering similar benefits to progressive distillation without needing to store intermediate checkpoints. Their method uses a random projection of the teacher's hidden representations to progressively train the student network before using the full network output, outperforming one-shot distillation and achieving comparable performance to progressive distillation.***  <br>  <br>
    Mar 21, Uni of Texas at Austin and Microsoft published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17494) “Efficient Knowledge Distillation via Curriculum Extraction”. Knowledge distillation is a technique used to train a small student network using the output generated by a large teacher network, and has many empirical advantages. While the standard one-shot approach to distillation only uses the output of the final teacher network, recent work has shown that using intermediate checkpoints from the teacher's training process as an implicit “curriculum” for progressive distillation can significantly speed up training. However, such schemes require storing these checkpoints, and often require careful selection of the intermediate checkpoints to train on, which can be impractical for large-scale training. This study shows that a curriculum can be extracted from just the fully trained teacher network, and that this extracted curriculum can give similar efficiency benefits to those of progressive distillation. The extraction scheme is natural; the authors use a random projection of the hidden representations of the teacher network to progressively train the student network, before training using the output of the full network. The study shows that the scheme significantly outperforms one-shot distillation and achieves a performance similar to that of progressive distillation for learning sparse parities with two-layer networks, and provide theoretical guarantees for this setting. Additionally, the study shows that the method outperforms one-shot distillation even when using transformer-based architectures, both for sparse-parity learning, and language modeling tasks.  <br>  <br>

35. ***Weight Rescaling Techniques Improve Variance Control in LLM Pre-training.   <br>BluOrion has introduced Layer Index Rescaling (LIR) and Target Variance Rescaling (TVR), novel weight initialization and variance control strategies for large language model pre-training. Experiments on a 1B parameter LLaMA model demonstrate that better variance management using these techniques leads to substantial improvements in downstream task performance and reduces extreme activation values, mitigating challenges related to quantization and low-precision training.***  <br>  <br>
    Mar 21, BluOrion published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17500) “Variance Control via Weight Rescaling in LLM Pre-training”. The outcome of Large Language Model (LLM) pre-training strongly depends on weight initialization and variance control strategies. Although the importance of initial variance control has been well documented in neural networks in general, the literature on initialization and management of its growth during LLM pre-training, specifically, is somewhat sparse. This work introduces the Layer Index Rescaling (LIR) weight initialization scheme, and the Target Variance Rescaling (TVR) variance control strategy. Experiments on a 1B parameter LLaMA model demonstrate that better variance management using these techniques yields substantial improvements in downstream task performance (up to 4.6% on common pre-training benchmarks) and reduces extreme activation values, thus mitigating challenges associated with quantization and low-precision training.

37. ***The KoLMogorov Test: Compression by Code Generation as an Intelligence Benchmark.   <br>Meta and Tel Aviv University have introduced the KoLMogorov-Test (KT), a compression-as-intelligence test for code-generating LLMs. KT challenges models to generate the shortest program that outputs a given sequence of data. Evaluation using audio, text, DNA, and synthetic program outputs reveals that current flagship models perform poorly, suggesting that new innovations are needed to better approximate Kolmogorov compression.***  <br>  <br>
    Mar 18, Meta and Tel Aviv Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13992v1) “The KoLMogorov Test: Compression by Code Generation”. Compression is at the heart of intelligence. A theoretically optimal way to compress any sequence of data is to find the shortest program that outputs that sequence and then halts. However, such Kolmogorov compression is uncomputable, and code generating LLMs struggle to approximate this theoretical ideal, as it requires reasoning, planning and search capabilities beyond those of current models. In this work, we introduce the KoLMogorov-Test (KT), a compression-as-intelligence test for code generating LLMs. In KT a model is presented with a sequence of data at inference time, and asked to generate the shortest program that produces the sequence. The study identifies several benefits of KT for both evaluation and training: an essentially infinite number of problem instances of varying difficulty is readily available, strong baselines already exist, the evaluation metric (compression) cannot be gamed, and pretraining data contamination is highly unlikely. To evaluate current models, the study uses audio, text, and DNA data, as well as sequences produced by random synthetic programs. Current flagship models perform poorly – both GPT4-o and Llama-3.1-405B struggle on the natural and synthetic sequences. On the synthetic distribution, the authors are able to train code generation models with lower compression rates than previous approaches. Moreover, the study shows that gains on synthetic data generalize poorly to real data, suggesting that new innovations are necessary for additional gains on KT.  <br>  <br>

39. ***A Multi-Modal Multi-Agent Framework for Enhanced Document Understanding.   <br>Researchers from UNC-Chapel Hill and Adobe have presented MDocAgent, a novel retrieval-augmented generation and multi-agent framework for Document Question Answering (DocQA). MDocAgent integrates both textual and visual cues from documents using five specialized agents that collaborate to achieve a more comprehensive understanding, leading to improved accuracy on multi-modal document understanding benchmarks.***  <br>  <br>
    Mar 18, UNC-Chapel Hill and Adobe published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13964) “MDocAgent: A Multi-Modal Multi-Agent Framework for Document Understanding”. Document Question Answering (DocQA) is a very common task. Existing methods using Large Language Models (LLMs) or Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) often prioritize information from a single modal, failing to effectively integrate textual and visual cues. These approaches struggle with complex multi-modal reasoning, limiting their performance on real-world documents. The study presents MDocAgent (A Multi-Modal Multi-Agent Framework for Document Understanding), a novel RAG and multi-agent framework that leverages both text and image. The system employs five specialized agents: a general agent, a critical agent, a text agent, an image agent and a summarizing agent. These agents engage in multi-modal context retrieval, combining their individual insights to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the document's content. This collaborative approach enables the system to synthesize information from both textual and visual components, leading to improved accuracy in question answering. Preliminary experiments on five benchmarks like MMLongBench, LongDocURL demonstrate the effectiveness of MDocAgent, achieve an average improvement of 12.1% compared to current state-of-the-art method. This work contributes to the development of more robust and comprehensive DocQA systems capable of handling the complexities of real-world documents containing rich textual and visual information. https://github.com/aiming-lab/mdocagent

1. ***New Benchmark Introduced:  <br>Meta and Inria's BigO(Bench) paper introduces a new coding benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to generate code with specified time and space complexities, including tools for complexity inference and a large dataset of annotated coding problems.*** <br> <br>
   Mar 21, Meta and Inria published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15242) “BigO(Bench) -- Can LLMs Generate Code with Controlled Time and Space Complexity?”. The study introduces BigO(Bench), a novel coding benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of generative language models in understanding and generating code with specified time and space complexities. This benchmark addresses the gap in current evaluations that often overlook the ability of models to comprehend and produce code constrained by computational complexity. BigO(Bench) includes tooling to infer the algorithmic complexity of any Python function from profiling measurements, including human- or LLM-generated solutions.

The study presents results from evaluating multiple state-of-the-art language models on this benchmark, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in handling complexity requirements. In particular, token-space reasoning models are unrivaled in code generation but not in complexity understanding, hinting that they may not generalize well to tasks for which no reward was given at training time.

3. ***R1-Zero Training Examined:  <br>Sea AI Lab's paper analyzes R1-Zero-like training for LLMs, revealing insights into pretraining characteristics, optimization biases, and presenting an improved, minimalist training recipe achieving state-of-the-art results on AIME 2024.*** <br> <br>
   Mar 21, Sea AI Lab et al published a [paper](https://github.com/sail-sg/understand-r1-zero/blob/main/understand-r1-zero.pdf) “Understanding R1-Zero-Like Training: A Critical Perspective”. DeepSeek-R1-Zero has shown that reinforcement learning (RL) at scale can directly enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs without supervised fine-tuning. This study critically examines R1-Zero-like training by analyzing its two core components: base models and RL. The study investigates a wide range of base models, including DeepSeek-V3-Base, to understand how pretraining characteristics influence RL performance. The analysis reveals that DeepSeek-V3-Base already exhibit “Aha moment”, while Qwen2.5 base models demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities even without prompt templates, suggesting potential pretraining biases. Additionally, the study identifies an optimization bias in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which artificially increases response length (especially for incorrect outputs) during training. To address this, the study introduces Dr. GRPO, an unbiased optimization method that improves token efficiency while maintaining reasoning performance. Leveraging these insights, the study presents a minimalist R1-Zero recipe that achieves 43.3% accuracy on AIME 2024 with a 7B base model, establishing a new state-of-the-art. <br> <br>

5. ***DeepFake Detection Enhanced:  <br>Google and the University of California introduced TruthLens, a novel framework for DeepFake detection that provides both real/fake classification and detailed textual reasoning, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and interpretability.*** <br> <br>
   Mar 20, Google and Uni of California published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15867v1) “TruthLens: Explainable DeepFake Detection for Face Manipulated and Fully Synthetic Data”. Detecting DeepFakes has become a crucial research area as the widespread use of AI image generators enables the effortless creation of face-manipulated and fully synthetic content, yet existing methods are often limited to binary classification (real vs. fake) and lack interpretability. To address these challenges, the study proposes TruthLens, a novel and highly generalizable framework for DeepFake detection that not only determines whether an image is real or fake but also provides detailed textual reasoning for its predictions. Unlike traditional methods, TruthLens effectively handles both face-manipulated DeepFakes and fully AI-generated content while addressing fine-grained queries such as "Does the eyes/nose/mouth look real or fake?" The architecture of TruthLens combines the global contextual understanding of multimodal large language models like PaliGemma2 with the localized feature extraction capabilities of vision-only models like DINOv2. This hybrid design leverages the complementary strengths of both models, enabling robust detection of subtle manipulations while maintaining interpretability. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that TruthLens outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy (by 2-14%) and explainability, in both in-domain and cross-data settings, generalizing effectively across traditional and emerging manipulation techniques. <br> <br>

7. ***Collaborative Reasoning Optimized:  <br>Meta and UC Berkeley's SWEET-RL algorithm and ColBench benchmark address multi-turn interactions in LLM agents, achieving improved success rates in collaborative content creation compared to other RL algorithms.*** <br> <br>
   Mar 20, Meta and UC Berkeley published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15478) “SWEET-RL: Training Multi-Turn LLM Agents on Collaborative Reasoning Tasks”. Large language model (LLM) agents need to perform multi-turn interactions in real-world tasks. However, existing multi-turn RL algorithms for optimizing LLM agents fail to perform effective credit assignment over multiple turns while leveraging the generalization capabilities of LLMs and it remains unclear how to develop such algorithms. To study this, the work first introduces a new benchmark, ColBench, where an LLM agent interacts with a human collaborator over multiple turns to solve realistic tasks in backend programming and frontend design. Building on this benchmark, the study proposes a novel RL algorithm, SWEET-RL (RL with Step-WisE Evaluation from Training-time information), that uses a carefully designed optimization objective to train a critic model with access to additional training-time information. The critic provides step-level rewards for improving the policy model. Experiments demonstrate that SWEET-RL achieves a 6% absolute improvement in success and win rates on ColBench compared to other state-of-the-art multi-turn RL algorithms, enabling Llama-3.1-8B to match or exceed the performance of GPT4-o in realistic collaborative content creation. <br> <br>

9. ***Long-Context Transformers Accelerated:  <br>Tsinghua University, MIT, SJTU, and NVIDIA's XAttention framework accelerates long-context inference in Transformers by using antidiagonal scoring for efficient block-sparse attention, achieving significant computational gains with comparable accuracy.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 20, Tsinghua Uni, MIT, SJTU and NVIDIA published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16428) “XAttention: Block Sparse Attention with Antidiagonal Scoring”. Long-Context Transformer Models (LCTMs) are vital for real-world applications but suffer high computational costs due to attention's quadratic complexity. Block-sparse attention mitigates this by focusing computation on critical regions, yet existing methods struggle with balancing accuracy and efficiency due to costly block importance measurements. This study introduces XAttention, a plug-and-play framework that dramatically accelerates long-context inference in Transformers models using sparse attention. XAttention's key innovation is the insight that the sum of antidiagonal values (i.e., from the lower-left to upper-right) in the attention matrix provides a powerful proxy for block importance. This allows for precise identification and pruning of non-essential blocks, resulting in high sparsity and dramatically accelerated inference. Across comprehensive evaluations on demanding long-context benchmarks-including RULER and LongBench for language, VideoMME for video understanding, and VBench for video generation. XAttention achieves accuracy comparable to full attention while delivering substantial computational gains. The work demonstrates up to 13.5x acceleration in attention computation. These results underscore XAttention's ability to unlock the practical potential of block sparse attention, paving the way for scalable and efficient deployment of LCTMs in real-world applications.

11. ***LLM Predictions Improved:  <br>UIUC and UC Davis introduce LLMBRACES, a novel method that refines LLM predictions by dynamically adjusting the contributions of sub-updates in feed-forward layers based on their relevance, improving accuracy, control over generation, and reducing tunable parameters.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 20, UIUC and UC Davis published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16334) “LLM Braces: Straightening Out LLM Predictions with Relevant Sub-Updates”. Recent findings reveal that much of the knowledge in a Transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) is encoded in its feed-forward (FFN) layers, where each FNN layer can be interpreted as the summation of sub-updates, each corresponding to a weighted column vector from the FFN's value parameter matrix that often encodes human-interpretable concepts. In light of this, the study hypothesizes that model performance and behaviors can be further enhanced and controlled by modulating the contributions of these sub-updates based on their relevance to the input or target output style, and propose LLMBRACES, a novel and efficient method that computes relevance scores associated with value vectors in FFN layers and leverages these scores to dynamically adjust the contribution of sub-updates. By optimizing sub-update contributions, LLMBRACES refines the prediction process, leading to more accurate and reliable outputs, much like a 'brace' providing support and stability. Moreover, LLMBRACES can be extended to support conditional control over generation characteristics, such as sentiment, thereby offering fine-grained steering of LLM outputs. Extensive experiments on various LLMs-including Qwen2.5-1.5B, Llama2-7B, and Llama3-8B-demonstrate that LLMBRACES outperforms baseline approaches in both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings while requiring significantly fewer tunable parameters, up to 75% fewer compared to LoRA. Furthermore, LLMBRACES excels in sentiment-controlled generation and toxicity reduction, highlighting its potential for flexible, controlled text generation across applications. <br> <br>

13. ***Generative AI Optimization Automated:  <br>Nature's paper presents TextGrad, a framework that uses LLM-generated feedback and backpropagation to automatically optimize generative AI systems across diverse tasks, improving performance and simplifying development.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 19, Nature published a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08661-4) “Optimizing generative AI by backpropagating language model feedback”. Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly driven by systems orchestrating multiple large language models (LLMs) and other specialized tools, such as search engines and simulators. So far, these systems are primarily handcrafted by domain experts and tweaked through heuristics rather than being automatically optimized, presenting a substantial challenge to accelerating progress. The development of artificial neural networks faced a similar challenge until backpropagation and automatic differentiation transformed the field by making optimization turnkey. Analogously, the study introduces TextGrad, a versatile framework that performs optimization by backpropagating LLM-generated feedback to improve AI systems. By leveraging natural language feedback to critique and suggest improvements to any part of a system—from prompts to outputs such as molecules or treatment plans—TextGrad enables the automatic optimization of generative AI systems across diverse tasks. The work demonstrates TextGrad’s generality and effectiveness through studies in solving PhD-level science problems, optimizing plans for radiotherapy treatments, designing molecules with specific properties, coding, and optimizing agentic systems. TextGrad empowers scientists and engineers to easily develop impactful generative AI systems. <br> <br>

15. ***Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuned:  <br>Mila and Reliant AI's TAPERED OFF-POLICY REINFORCE (TOPR) algorithm improves reinforcement learning for LLMs by using an asymmetric, tapered variant of importance sampling, enhancing learning stability, data efficiency, and accuracy.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 19, Mila and Reliant AI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14286v1) "TAPERED OFF-POLICY REINFORCE Stable and efficient reinforcement learning for LLMs". The study proposes a new algorithm for fine-tuning large language models using reinforcement learning. Tapered Off-Policy REINFORCE (TOPR) uses an asymmetric, tapered variant of importance sampling to speed up learning while maintaining stable learning dynamics, even without the use of KL regularization. TOPR can be applied in a fully offline fashion, allows the handling of positive and negative examples in a unified framework, and benefits from the implementational simplicity that is typical of Monte Carlo algorithms. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach with a series of experiments on the GSM8K and MATH reasoning benchmarks, finding performance gains for training both a model for solution generation and as a generative verifier. The study shows that properly leveraging positive and negative examples alike in the off-policy regime simultaneously increases test-time accuracy and training data efficiency, all the while avoiding the “wasted inference” that comes with discarding negative examples. The study finds that this advantage persists over multiple iterations of training and can be amplified by dataset curation techniques, enabling to match 70B-parameter model performance with 8B language models. As a corollary to this work, the study finds that REINFORCE’s baseline parameter plays an important and unexpected role in defining dataset composition in the presence of negative examples, and is consequently critical in driving off-policy performance. <br> <br>

The paper presents EXAONE Deep series, which exhibits superior capabilities in various reasoning tasks, including math and coding benchmarks. The study trains the models mainly on the reasoning-specialized dataset that incorporates long streams of thought processes.

19. ***AI-Generated Newspaper Published:  <br>An Italian newspaper, Il Foglio, claims to be the first to publish an entire edition generated by artificial intelligence as part of an experiment to explore AI's role in journalism.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 19, according to [theguardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/18/italian-newspaper-says-it-has-published-worlds-first-ai-generated-edition), Italian newspaper says it has published world’s first AI-generated edition. Il Foglio, an Italian newspaper, claims to be the first in the world to publish an edition entirely produced by artificial intelligence (AI). This initiative is part of a month-long experiment to demonstrate AI's impact on journalism. The AI-generated edition, available both in print and online, includes articles, headlines, quotes, and even irony, with journalists only asking questions and reading AI-generated responses. The front page features stories on Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, while other articles discuss the Italian economy and young Europeans' relationship trends. The edition also includes AI-generated letters from readers. Editor Claudio Cerasa emphasizes that this experiment aims to explore AI's practical application in journalism and its broader implications. <br> <br>

21. ***Pretraining Strategy Optimized:  <br>National University of Singapore, Sea AI Lab, and CUHK's SkyLadder approach improves LLM pretraining by implementing a short-to-long context window transition, achieving faster training speeds and performance gains.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 19, National Uni. of Singapore, Sea AI Lab and CUHK published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15450) “SkyLadder: Better and Faster Pretraining via Context Window Scheduling”. Recent advancements in LLM pretraining have featured ever-expanding context windows to process longer sequences. However, a pilot study reveals that models pretrained with shorter context windows consistently outperform their long-context counterparts under a fixed token budget. This finding motivates the authors to explore an optimal context window scheduling strategy to better balance long-context capability with pretraining efficiency. To this end, the study proposes SkyLadder, a simple yet effective approach that implements a short-to-long context window transition. SkyLadder preserves strong standard benchmark performance, while matching or exceeding baseline results on long context tasks. Through extensive experiments, the study pre-trains 1B-parameter models (up to 32K context) and 3B-parameter models (8K context) on 100B tokens, demonstrating that SkyLadder yields consistent gains of up to 3.7% on common benchmarks, while achieving up to 22% faster training speeds compared to baselines.

23. ***Hidden Factual Knowledge Explored:  <br>Israel Institute of Technology and Google's research reveals that LLMs encode more factual knowledge internally than they express externally, highlighting limitations in generation capabilities.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 19, Israel Inst of Tech and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15299) “Inside-Out: Hidden Factual Knowledge in LLMs”. This work presents a framework for assessing whether large language models (LLMs) encode more factual knowledge in their parameters than what they express in their outputs. While a few studies hint at this possibility, none has clearly defined or demonstrated this phenomenon. This study first proposes a formal definition of knowledge, quantifying it for a given question as the fraction of correct-incorrect answer pairs where the correct one is ranked higher. This gives rise to external and internal knowledge, depending on the information used to score individual answer candidates: either the model's observable token-level probabilities or its intermediate computations. Hidden knowledge arises when internal knowledge exceeds external knowledge. The study then presents a case study, applying this framework to three popular open-weights LLMs in a closed-book QA setup. Results indicate that: (1) LLMs consistently encode more factual knowledge internally than what they express externally, with an average gap of 40%. (2) Surprisingly, some knowledge is so deeply hidden that a model can internally know an answer perfectly, yet fail to generate it even once, despite large-scale repeated sampling of 1,000 answers. This reveals fundamental limitations in the generation capabilities of LLMs, which (3) puts a practical constraint on scaling test-time compute via repeated answer sampling in closed-book QA: significant performance improvements remain inaccessible because some answers are practically never sampled, yet if they were, researchers would be guaranteed to rank them first. <br> <br>

25. ***Claim Verification Improved:  <br>The University of Notre Dame proposes dynamic decomposition, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifier feedback to learn an optimal decomposition policy for improving the factuality verification of long-form text.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 19, Uni of Notre Dame published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15354) “Optimizing Decomposition for Optimal Claim Verification”. Current research on the Decompose-Then-Verify paradigm for evaluating the factuality of long-form text typically treats decomposition and verification in isolation, overlooking their interactions and potential misalignment. The study finds that existing decomposition policies, typically hand-crafted demonstrations, do not align well with downstream verifiers in terms of atomicity -- a novel metric quantifying information density -- leading to suboptimal verification results. The study formulates finding the optimal decomposition policy for optimal verification as a bilevel optimization problem. To approximate a solution for this strongly NP-hard problem, the work proposes dynamic decomposition, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifier feedback to learn a policy for dynamically decomposing claims to verifier-preferred atomicity. Experimental results show that dynamic decomposition outperforms existing decomposition policies, improving verification confidence by 0.07 and accuracy by 0.12 (on a 0-1 scale) on average across varying verifiers, datasets, and atomcities of input claims. <br> <br>

27. ***AI Agents Learn Through Collaboration:  <br>Google introduces collaborative self-play as a new approach to teach AI agents about their capabilities and limitations, improving tool use and selective prediction through group-level rewards.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 18, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14481) "Don't lie to your friends Learning what you know from collaborative self-play". To be helpful assistants, AI agents must be aware of their own capabilities and limitations. This includes knowing when to answer from parametric knowledge versus using tools, when to trust tool outputs, and when to abstain or hedge. Such capabilities are hard to teach through supervised fine-tuning because they require constructing examples that reflect the agent's specific capabilities. The work therefore proposes a radically new approach to teaching agents what they know: collaborative self-play. The study constructs multi-agent collaborations in which the group is rewarded for collectively arriving at correct answers. The desired meta-knowledge emerges from the incentives built into the structure of the interaction. The study focuses on small societies of agents that have access to heterogeneous tools (corpus-specific retrieval), and therefore must collaborate to maximize their success while minimizing their effort. Experiments show that group-level rewards for multi-agent communities can induce policies that transfer to improve tool use and selective prediction in settings where individual agents are deployed in isolation. <br> <br>

29. ***Linear RNN Kernels Made More Efficient:  <br>ELLIS and NXAI present Tiled Flash Linear Attention (TFLA), a novel kernel algorithm for linear RNNs, enabling faster and more efficient long-context sequence modeling primitives.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 18, ELLIS and NXAI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14376) "Tiled Flash Linear Attention More Efficient Linear RNN and xLSTM Kernels". Linear RNNs with gating recently demonstrated competitive performance compared to Transformers in language modeling. Although their linear compute scaling in sequence length offers theoretical runtime advantages over Transformers, realizing these benefits in practice requires optimized custom kernels, as Transformers rely on the highly efficient Flash Attention kernels. Leveraging the chunkwise-parallel formulation of linear RNNs, Flash Linear Attention (FLA) shows that linear RNN kernels are faster than Flash Attention, by parallelizing over chunks of the input sequence. However, since the chunk size of FLA is limited, many intermediate states must be materialized in GPU memory. This leads to low arithmetic intensity and causes high memory consumption and IO cost, especially for long-context pre-training. This studypresents Tiled Flash Linear Attention (TFLA), a novel kernel algorithm for linear RNNs, that enables arbitrary large chunk sizes by introducing an additional level of sequence parallelization within each chunk. First, the authors apply TFLA to the xLSTM with matrix memory, the mLSTM. Second, the study proposes an mLSTM variant with sigmoid input gate and reduced computation for even faster kernel runtimes at equal language modeling performance. In the speed benchmarks, the study shows that the new mLSTM kernels based on TFLA outperform highly optimized Flash Attention, Linear Attention and Mamba kernels, setting a new state of the art for efficient long-context sequence modeling primitives.

31. ***AI Task Completion Ability Quantified:  <br>Model Evaluation & Threat Research proposes a new metric, 50%-task-completion time horizon, to quantify AI system capabilities in terms of human capabilities, showing a doubling trend in AI time horizon approximately every seven months.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 18, Model Evaluation & Threat Research published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14499) "Measuring AI Ability to Complete Long Tasks". Despite rapid progress on AI benchmarks, the real-world meaning of benchmark performance remains unclear. To quantify the capabilities of AI systems in terms of human capabilities, the study proposes a new metric: 50%-task-completion time horizon. This is the time humans typically take to complete tasks that AI models can complete with 50% success rate. The study first timed humans with relevant domain expertise on a combination of RE-Bench, HCAST, and 66 novel shorter tasks. On these tasks, current frontier AI models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet have a 50% time horizon of around 50 minutes. Furthermore, frontier AI time horizon has been doubling approximately every seven months since 2019, though the trend may have accelerated in 2024. The increase in AI models' time horizons seems to be primarily driven by greater reliability and ability to adapt to mistakes, combined with better logical reasoning and tool use capabilities. The study discusses the limitations of the results -- including their degree of external validity -- and the implications of increased autonomy for dangerous capabilities. If these results generalize to real-world software tasks, extrapolation of this trend predicts that within 5 years, AI systems will be capable of automating many software tasks that currently take humans a month. <br> <br>

33. ***Automated Code Refactoring Enhanced:  <br>Concordia University introduces MANTRA, an LLM agent-based framework that automates method-level refactoring with high success rates in producing compilable and test-passing code, outperforming existing methods.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 18, Concordia Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14340) "MANTRA Enhancing Automated Method-Level Refactoring with Contextual RAG and Multi-Agent LLM Collaboration". Maintaining and scaling software systems relies heavily on effective code refactoring, yet this process remains labor-intensive, requiring developers to carefully analyze existing codebases and prevent the introduction of new defects. Although recent advancements have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate refactoring tasks, current solutions are constrained in scope and lack mechanisms to guarantee code compilability and successful test execution. This studyintroduces MANTRA, a comprehensive LLM agent-based framework that automates method-level refactoring. MANTRA integrates Context-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation, coordinated Multi-Agent Collaboration, and Verbal Reinforcement Learning to emulate human decision-making during refactoring while preserving code correctness and readability. The empirical study, conducted on 703 instances of "pure refactorings" (i.e., code changes exclusively involving structural improvements), drawn from 10 representative Java projects, covers the six most prevalent refactoring operations. Experimental results demonstrate that MANTRA substantially surpasses a baseline LLM model (RawGPT ), achieving an 82.8% success rate (582/703) in producing code that compiles and passes all tests, compared to just 8.7% (61/703) with RawGPT. Moreover, in comparison to IntelliJ's LLM-powered refactoring tool (EM-Assist), MANTRA exhibits a 50% improvement in generating Extract Method transformations. A usability study involving 37 professional developers further shows that refactorings performed by MANTRA are perceived to be as readable and reusable as human-written code, and in certain cases, even more favorable. These results highlight the practical advantages of MANTRA and emphasize the growing potential of LLM-based systems in advancing the automation of software refactoring tasks.  <br> <br>

35. ***AI Agents Play Thousands of Games:  <br>Tencent presents PORTAL, a framework for developing AI agents that can play thousands of 3D video games through language-guided policy generation, achieving improved development efficiency and generalization.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 17, Tencent published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13356) “Agents Play Thousands of 3D Video Games”. The work presents PORTAL, a novel framework for developing artificial intelligence agents capable of playing thousands of 3D video games through language-guided policy generation. By transforming decision-making problems into language modeling tasks, the approach leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate behavior trees represented in domain-specific language (DSL). This method eliminates the computational burden associated with traditional reinforcement learning approaches while preserving strategic depth and rapid adaptability. The framework introduces a hybrid policy structure that combines rule-based nodes with neural network components, enabling both high-level strategic reasoning and precise low-level control. A dual-feedback mechanism incorporating quantitative game metrics and vision-language model analysis facilitates iterative policy improvement at both tactical and strategic levels. The resulting policies are instantaneously deployable, human-interpretable, and capable of generalizing across diverse gaming environments. Experimental results demonstrate PORTAL's effectiveness across thousands of first-person shooter (FPS) games, showcasing significant improvements in development efficiency, policy generalization, and behavior diversity compared to traditional approaches. PORTAL represents a significant advancement in game AI development, offering a practical solution for creating sophisticated agents that can operate across thousands of commercial video games with minimal development overhead. Experiment results on the 3D video games are best viewed on https://zhongwen.one/projects/portal. <br> <br>

37. ***Multimodal Reasoning Benchmark Created:  <br>Stanford University, Tsinghua University, Princeton University, and others introduce MicroVQA, a multimodal reasoning benchmark for microscopy-based scientific research, designed to assess expert image understanding, hypothesis generation, and experiment proposal.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 17, Stanford Uni, Tsinghua Uni, Princeton Uni et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13399) “MicroVQA: A Multimodal Reasoning Benchmark for Microscopy-Based Scientific Research”. Scientific research demands sophisticated reasoning over multimodal data, a challenge especially prevalent in biology. Despite recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for AI-assisted research, existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks only target up to college-level difficulty, while research-level benchmarks emphasize lower-level perception, falling short of the complex multimodal reasoning needed for scientific discovery. To bridge this gap, the study introduces MicroVQA, a visual-question answering (VQA) benchmark designed to assess three reasoning capabilities vital in research workflows: expert image understanding, hypothesis generation, and experiment proposal. MicroVQA consists of 1,042 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) curated by biology experts across diverse microscopy modalities, ensuring VQA samples represent real scientific practice. In constructing the benchmark, the study finds that standard MCQ generation methods induce language shortcuts, motivating a new two-stage pipeline: an optimized LLM prompt structures question-answer pairs into MCQs; then, an agent-based `RefineBot' updates them to remove shortcuts. Benchmarking on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a peak performance of 53\%; models with smaller LLMs only slightly underperform top models, suggesting that language-based reasoning is less challenging than multimodal reasoning; and tuning with scientific articles enhances performance. Expert analysis of chain-of-thought responses shows that perception errors are the most frequent, followed by knowledge errors and then overgeneralization errors. These insights highlight the challenges in multimodal scientific reasoning, showing MicroVQA is a valuable resource advancing AI-driven biomedical research. MicroVQA is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jmhb/microvqa, and project page at https://jmhb0.github.io/microvqa <br> <br>

    Mar 17, Mistral released [Mistral Small 3](https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-small-3-1), new model comes with improved text performance, multimodal understanding, and an expanded context window of up to 128k tokens. The model outperforms comparable models like Gemma 3 and GPT-4o Mini, while delivering inference speeds of 150 tokens per second. Mistral Small 3.1 can run on a single RTX 4090 or a Mac with 32GB RAM. This makes it a great fit for on-device use cases. It's ideal for virtual assistants and other applications where quick, accurate responses are essential, and capable of rapid function execution within automated or agentic workflows. Mistral Small 3.1 can be fine-tuned to specialize in specific domains, creating accurate subject matter experts. This is particularly useful in fields like legal advice, medical diagnostics, and technical support. Mistral Small 3.1 can be used across various enterprise and consumer applications that require multimodal understanding, such as document verification, diagnostics, on-device image processing, visual inspection for quality checks, object detection in security systems, image-based customer support, and general purpose assistance. <br> <br>

41. ***New Tokenization Scheme Improves Language Models:  <br>The University of Washington, Nvidia, and the Allen Institute for AI introduce SuperBPE, a superword tokenizer that improves language model encoding efficiency and downstream performance by learning tokens that bridge whitespace.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 17, Uni of Washington, Nvidia and Allen Inst for AI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13423) “SuperBPE: Space Travel for Language Models”. The assumption across nearly all language model (LM) tokenization schemes is that tokens should be subwords, i.e., contained within word boundaries. While providing a seemingly reasonable inductive bias, is this common practice limiting the potential of modern LMs? Whitespace is not a reliable delimiter of meaning, as evidenced by multi-word expressions (e.g., "by the way"), crosslingual variation in the number of words needed to express a concept (e.g., "spacesuit helmet" in German is "raumanzughelm"), and languages that do not use whitespace at all (e.g., Chinese). To explore the potential of tokenization beyond subwords, the study introduces a "superword" tokenizer, SuperBPE, which incorporates a simple pretokenization curriculum into the byte-pair encoding (BPE) algorithm to first learn subwords, then superwords that bridge whitespace. This brings dramatic improvements in encoding efficiency: when fixing the vocabulary size to 200k, SuperBPE encodes a fixed piece of text with up to 33% fewer tokens than BPE on average. In experiments, the work pretrains 8B transformer LMs from scratch while fixing the model size, vocabulary size, and train compute, varying *only* the algorithm for learning the vocabulary. The model trained with SuperBPE achieves an average +4.0% absolute improvement over the BPE baseline across 30 downstream tasks (including +8.2% on MMLU), while simultaneously requiring 27% less compute at inference time. In analysis, the work finds that SuperBPE results in segmentations of text that are more uniform in per-token difficulty. Qualitatively, this may be because SuperBPE tokens often capture common multi-word expressions that function semantically as a single unit. SuperBPE is a straightforward, local modification to tokenization that improves both encoding efficiency and downstream performance, yielding better language models overall. <br> <br>

    Mar 17, MIT, Stanford and UIUC published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13751) "Optimizing ML Training with Metagradient Descent". A major challenge in training large-scale machine learning models is configuring the training process to maximize model performance, i.e., finding the best training setup from a vast design space.This study unlocks a gradient-based approach to this problem. The study first introduces an algorithm for efficiently calculating metagradients -- gradients through model training -- at scale. The work then introduces a "smooth model training" framework that enables effective optimization using metagradients. With metagradient descent (MGD), the work greatly improves on existing dataset selection methods, outperform accuracy-degrading data poisoning attacks by an order of magnitude, and automatically find competitive learning rate schedules. <br> <br>

45. ***Generative Modeling for Mathematical Discovery Enhanced:  <br>The University of Wisconsin-Madison, the University of Oxford, and MIT present a new, practical implementation of the LLM-driven genetic algorithm funsearch, designed to be useful for working mathematicians without requiring machine learning expertise.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 17, Uni of Wisconsin-Madison, Uni of Oxford and MIT published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11061) “Generative Modeling for Mathematical Discovery”. The study presents a new implementation of the LLM-driven genetic algorithm funsearch, whose aim is to generate examples of interest to mathematicians and which has already had some success in problems in extremal combinatorics. The implementation is designed to be useful in practice for working mathematicians; it does not require expertise in machine learning or access to high-performance computing resources. Applying funsearch to a new problem involves modifying a small segment of Python code and selecting a large language model (LLM) from one of many third-party providers. The work benchmarked the implementation on three different problems, obtaining metrics that may inform applications of funsearch to new problems. The results demonstrate that funsearch successfully learns in a variety of combinatorial and number-theoretic settings, and in some contexts learns principles that generalize beyond the problem originally trained on. <br> <br>
 
47. ***Call for AGI Preparedness Made:  <br>The New York Times argues that powerful AI is advancing rapidly and may soon achieve AGI, requiring proactive preparation from governments and institutions to avoid potential risks and loss of control.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 14, TheNewYorkTimes published an [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/technology/why-im-feeling-the-agi.html) “Powerful A.I. Is Coming. We're Not Ready. - AGI Optimisation”. The author argues that artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing rapidly, already surpassing human capabilities in areas like math, coding, and medical diagnosis, and may soon achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI systems capable of performing most cognitive tasks as well as humans. While debates about the definition of AGI will persist, the more pressing reality is the rise of powerful AI systems reshaping economies and geopolitics. The author believes governments and institutions are woefully unprepared for this transformation, and that skepticism around AI progress fosters dangerous complacency. Drawing from extensive discussions with AI engineers, investors, and researchers, the author notes that insiders, including AI executives and independent experts, anticipate AGI’s arrival within a few years. These experts express serious concerns about AI's rapid improvement, including its potential for deception and autonomy. Today’s models are far more capable than those of just a few years ago, with reasoning models solving complex problems and contributing to real-world tasks. AI tools are now integral to knowledge work and software development, with many start-ups relying heavily on AI for product creation. While there may be unforeseen barriers to AGI, the author argues for proactive preparation, such as upgrading infrastructure, implementing sensible regulations, and promoting AI literacy. Delaying action could repeat the mistakes of the social media era, where society failed to anticipate risks until they became entrenched. Ultimately, the author believes humans must take AGI seriously now, not because its arrival is guaranteed or imminent, but because the stakes are too high to ignore. If we fail to prepare, we risk losing control over a transformative technology that could reshape the world in unpredictable and profound ways. <br> <br>
 
49. ***Planning with Conceptual Diagrams Improves LMMs:  <br>Xero, UC Berkeley, and MIT-IBM demonstrate that enabling Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to reason through self-generated conceptual diagrams significantly enhances their combinatorial planning capabilities.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 14, Xero, UC Berkeley and MIT-IBM published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11790) “Visualizing Thought: Conceptual Diagrams Enable Robust Planning in LMMs”. Human reasoning relies on constructing and manipulating mental models-simplified internal representations of situations that are used to understand and solve problems. Conceptual diagrams (for example, sketches drawn by humans to aid reasoning) externalize these mental models, abstracting irrelevant details to efficiently capture relational and spatial information. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) predominantly reason through textual representations, limiting their effectiveness in complex multi-step combinatorial and planning tasks. This study proposes a zero-shot fully automatic framework that enables LMMs to reason through multiple chains of self-generated intermediate conceptual diagrams, significantly enhancing their combinatorial planning capabilities. The approach does not require any human initialization beyond a natural language description of the task. It integrates both textual and diagrammatic reasoning within an optimized graph-of-thought inference framework, enhanced by beam search and depth-wise backtracking. Evaluated on multiple challenging PDDL planning domains, the method substantially improves GPT-4o's performance (for example, from 35.5% to 90.2% in Blocksworld). On more difficult planning domains with solution depths up to 40, the approach outperforms even the o1-preview reasoning model (for example, over 13% improvement in Parking). These results highlight the value of conceptual diagrams as a complementary reasoning medium in LMMs. <br> <br>
 
51. ***Compact Vision-Language Model for Document Conversion Introduced:  <br>IBM and HuggingFace present SmolDocling, an ultra-compact vision-language model targeting end-to-end document conversion by processing entire pages and generating DocTags, outperforming larger models.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 14, IBM and HuggingFace published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11576) “SmolDocling: An ultra-compact vision-language model for end-to-end multi-modal document conversion”. The study introduces SmolDocling, an ultra-compact vision-language model targeting end-to-end document conversion. The model comprehensively processes entire pages by generating DocTags, a new universal markup format that captures all page elements in their full context with location. Unlike existing approaches that rely on large foundational models, or ensemble solutions that rely on handcrafted pipelines of multiple specialized models, SmolDocling offers an end-to-end conversion for accurately capturing content, structure and spatial location of document elements in a 256M parameters vision-language model. SmolDocling exhibits robust performance in correctly reproducing document features such as code listings, tables, equations, charts, lists, and more across a diverse range of document types including business documents, academic papers, technical reports, patents, and forms -- significantly extending beyond the commonly observed focus on scientific papers. Additionally, the study contributes novel publicly sourced datasets for charts, tables, equations, and code recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that SmolDocling competes with other Vision Language Models that are up to 27 times larger in size, while reducing computational requirements substantially. The model is [currently available](https://huggingface.co/ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview), datasets will be publicly available soon. <br> <br>
 
53. ***LLMs Fail to Introspect About Their Knowledge of Language:  <br>The University of Texas at Austin and Harvard University find that LLMs do not have privileged "self-access" to their internal linguistic knowledge, complicating recent claims about LLM introspection.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 12, Uni of Texas at Austin and Harvard Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07513) “Language Models Fail to Introspect About Their Knowledge of Language”. There has been recent interest in whether large language models (LLMs) can introspect about their own internal states. Such abilities would make LLMs more interpretable, and also validate the use of standard introspective methods in linguistics to evaluate grammatical knowledge in models (e.g., asking "Is this sentence grammatical?"). The study systematically investigates emergent introspection across 21 open-source LLMs, in two domains where introspection is of theoretical interest: grammatical knowledge and word prediction. Crucially, in both domains, a model's internal linguistic knowledge can be theoretically grounded in direct measurements of string probability. The work then evaluates whether models' responses to metalinguistic prompts faithfully reflect their internal knowledge. The study proposes a new measure of introspection: the degree to which a model's prompted responses predict its own string probabilities, beyond what would be predicted by another model with nearly identical internal knowledge. While both metalinguistic prompting and probability comparisons lead to high task accuracy, the work does not find evidence that LLMs have privileged "self-access". The findings complicate recent results suggesting that models can introspect, and add new evidence to the argument that prompted responses should not be conflated with models' linguistic generalizations. <br> <br>
 
55. ***Intelligence Explosion Examined:  <br>forethought.org explores the concept of an intelligence explosion (IE), identifying three feedback loops that could drive rapid advancements in AI capabilities and discussing their implications for power distribution and strategic planning.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 11,  forethought.org published an [article](https://www.forethought.org/research/preparing-for-the-intelligence-explosion) “Preparing for the Intelligence Explosion”. The article discusses the concept of an intelligence explosion (IE), where AI systems design and build more capable AI systems, leading to rapid advancements in AI capabilities. It identifies three feedback loops that could drive different types of IEs: software, chip technology, and chip production. A software IE involves improvements in AI software alone, an AI-technology IE includes both software and chip technology advancements, and a full-stack IE incorporates all three feedback loops. Even if a software IE plateaus, AI-technology and full-stack IEs could still occur, potentially accelerating AI progress significantly. Each feedback loop could increase effective compute by 20-30 orders of magnitude before hitting physical limits, enabling dramatic improvements in AI capabilities. The type of IE has implications for power distribution: a software IE would likely concentrate power within one country or company, while a full-stack IE would spread power across multiple countries and industries. The analysis suggests that while software and AI-technology IEs are more likely to accelerate, a full-stack IE is very likely to eventually accelerate, especially if physical limits are distant. The strategic implications vary, with a software IE likely occurring first in the US, an AI-technology IE involving countries in the semiconductor supply chain, and a full-stack IE potentially involving countries with strong industrial bases and permissive regulatory environments. <br> <br>

57. ***Human Intuition Valued in AI Era:  <br>Forbes discusses the shift in Silicon Valley where venture capitalists are prioritizing product intuition ("Vibe Coding") over pure coding skills due to the code generation capabilities of AI tools.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 10, Forbes published an [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/josipamajic/2025/03/10/vibe-coding-the-ai-revolution-thats-making-vcs-bet-big-on-human-intuition/) “The AI Revolution That’s Making VCs Bet Big On Human Intuition”. In Silicon Valley, a radical shift known as "Vibe Coding" is transforming traditional software development. Venture capitalists are now prioritizing product intuition over pure coding skills, as AI tools enable even non-technical founders to generate code rapidly. This shift is leading to the emergence of "product engineers," where human taste and product intuition are paramount. Despite the rapid code generation capabilities of AI, challenges remain, particularly in debugging complex issues, which still require human intervention. Companies must invest in robust code review processes and debugging tools to maintain software quality and security. The "Vibe Coding Playbook" suggests strategies for AI-native startups, including doubling down on AI development tools, hiring for taste and training for technique, embracing the product-engineer hybrid role, adopting parallel workflows, and mastering system architecture. This revolution is seen as the most significant shift since open-source development, offering new opportunities for investors and lowering the cost of turning ideas into products. The rapid acceleration in coding speed, from 10x to 100x, indicates that this transformation is just beginning. Companies that foster cultures of experimentation and continuous learning will be best positioned to capitalize on vibe coding's potential. The shift is fundamentally rewriting the startup playbook, with product intuition now trumping coding credentials, emotional detachment from code becoming an asset, and the democratization of development breaking down barriers between technical and non-technical founders. Forward-thinking VCs are adapting their investment strategies, as traditional engineering metrics become obsolete in this new paradigm. <br> <br>
 
59. ***Robustness of MoE Routers Demonstrated:  <br>The University of Montreal, MILA, and others show that sparsely-activated Mixture of Experts (MoE) transformers are surprisingly robust to distribution shifts during continual pre-training, even without replay.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 6, Uni of Montreal, MILA et al. published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05029) “Continual Pre-training of MoEs: How robust is your router?”. Sparsely-activated Mixture of Experts (MoE) transformers are promising architectures for foundation models. Compared to dense transformers that require the same amount of floating point operations (FLOPs) per forward pass, MoEs benefit from improved sample efficiency at training time and achieve much stronger performance. Many closed-source and open-source frontier language models have thus adopted an MoE architecture. Naturally, practitioners will want to extend the capabilities of these models with large amounts of newly collected data without completely re-training them. Prior work has shown that a simple combination of replay and learning rate re-warming and re-decaying can enable the continual pre-training (CPT) of dense decoder-only transformers with minimal performance degradation compared to full re-training. In the case of decoder-only MoE transformers, however, it is unclear how the routing algorithm will impact continual pre-training performance: 1) do the MoE transformer's routers exacerbate forgetting relative to a dense model?; 2) do the routers maintain a balanced load on previous distributions after CPT?; 3) are the same strategies applied to dense models sufficient to continually pre-train MoE LLMs? In what follows, the study conduct a large-scale (>2B parameter switch and DeepSeek MoE LLMs trained for 600B tokens) empirical study across four MoE transformers to answer these questions. The results establish a surprising robustness to distribution shifts for both Sinkhorn-Balanced and Z-and-Aux-loss-balanced routing algorithms, even in MoEs continually pre-trained without replay. Moreover, the study shows that MoE LLMs maintain their sample efficiency (relative to a FLOP-matched dense model) during CPT and that they can match the performance of a fully re-trained MoE at a fraction of the cost.

1. ***Meta's Dynamic Tanh Enables Transformers Without Normalization.  <br>Meta researchers have demonstrated that normalization layers, traditionally considered essential in neural networks, can be effectively replaced by a simple element-wise operation called Dynamic Tanh (DyT) in Transformers. This allows Transformers without normalization to achieve performance comparable to or even better than their normalized counterparts across various tasks and modalities, challenging the necessity of normalization in deep learning.*** <br> <br>
   Mar 14, Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10622) “Transformers without Normalization”. Normalization layers are ubiquitous in modern neural networks and have long been considered essential. This work demonstrates that Transformers without normalization can achieve the same or better performance using a remarkably simple technique. The study introduces Dynamic Tanh (DyT), an element-wise operation DyT(x)=tanh(αx), as a drop-in replacement for normalization layers in Transformers. DyT is inspired by the observation that layer normalization in Transformers often produces tanh-like, S-shaped input-output mappings. By incorporating DyT, Transformers without normalization can match or exceed the performance of their normalized counterparts, mostly without hyperparameter tuning. The study validates the effectiveness of Transformers with DyT across diverse settings, ranging from recognition to generation, supervised to self-supervised learning, and computer vision to language models. These findings challenge the conventional understanding that normalization layers are indispensable in modern neural networks, and offer new insights into their role in deep networks. <br> <br>

3. ***Scaling Laws for LLMs Vary Based on Skill Type.  <br>A study by the University of Wisconsin and Meta indicates that compute-optimal scaling laws for large language models are skill-dependent, specifically for knowledge-based QA and code generation. This finding suggests that the optimal trade-off between parameter count and dataset size differs based on the desired skill. Further analysis, even after accounting for pretraining data mix variations, confirms fundamental differences in scaling behavior between knowledge and code-related tasks. The study also highlights the impact of validation set composition on determining compute-optimal parameters.*** <br> <br>
   Mar 13, Uni of Wisconsin and Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10061) “Compute Optimal Scaling of Skills: Knowledge vs Reasoning”. Scaling laws are a critical component of the LLM development pipeline, most famously as a way to forecast training decisions such as 'compute-optimally' trading-off parameter count and dataset size, alongside a more recent growing list of other crucial decisions. This study asks whether compute-optimal scaling behaviour can be skill-dependent. In particular, the work examines knowledge and reasoning-based skills such as knowledge-based QA and code generation, and answers this question in the affirmative: scaling laws are skill-dependent. Next, to understand whether skill-dependent scaling is an artefact of the pretraining datamix, the study conducts an extensive ablation of different datamixes and find that, also when correcting for datamix differences, knowledge and code exhibit fundamental differences in scaling behaviour. The study concludes with an analysis of how the findings relate to standard compute-optimal scaling using a validation set, and find that a misspecified validation set can impact compute-optimal parameter count by nearly 50%, depending on its skill composition. <br> <br>

5. ***KV-Distill Compresses LLM Context with Minimal Performance Loss.  <br>Researchers from Johns Hopkins University and Microsoft have introduced KV-Distill, a framework for compressing the KV cache in Transformer-based language models, significantly reducing memory usage during long context processing. This method distills long context KV caches into shorter, question-independent representations and can be trained as a parameter-efficient adaptor. KV-Distill outperforms other compression techniques in challenging tasks and closely matches uncompressed performance in question answering and summarization, with potential for up to 99% context length reduction with domain-specific fine-tuning.*** <br> <br>
   Mar 13, Johns Hopkins Uni and Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10337) “KV-Distill: Nearly Lossless Learnable Context Compression for LLMs”. Sequence-to-sequence tasks often benefit from long contexts, but the quadratic complexity of self-attention in standard Transformers renders this non-trivial. During generation, temporary representations -stored in the so-called KV cache-account for a large portion of GPU memory usage and scale linearly with context length. The study introduces KV-Distill, a Transformer compression framework that distills long context KV caches into significantly shorter representations in a question-independent fashion. KV-Distill can be trained as a parameter-efficient adaptor for pretrained models, and enables the compression of arbitrary spans of a context while preserving pre-trained model capabilities. The work treats a compressed-uncompressed cache as a student-teacher pairing and apply a KL-type divergence to match the generated outputs. KV-Distill outperforms other compression techniques in worst-case extractive tasks and approaches uncompressed performance in long context question answering and summarization, and it can be fine-tuned on domain-specific contexts to reduce lengths by up to 99% while preserving downstream performance. The study demonstrates the generalizability of KV-Distill across various model sizes and architectures. <br> <br>

9. ***LocAgent Uses Graph-Guided LLM Agents for Precise Code Localization.  <br>Yale University, the University of Southern California, Stanford University, and All Hands AI have developed LocAgent, a framework that utilizes graph-based representations to improve code localization. By converting codebases into directed heterogeneous graphs capturing structure and dependencies, LocAgent enables LLM agents to efficiently search and identify relevant code sections through multi-hop reasoning. Experiments show significant accuracy improvements in code localization, with a fine-tuned Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct-32B model achieving comparable results to proprietary models at a substantially reduced cost.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 12, Yale Uni, Uni of Southern California, Stanford Uni and All Hands AI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09089) “LocAgent: Graph-Guided LLM Agents for Code Localization”. Code localization--identifying precisely where in a codebase changes need to be made--is a fundamental yet challenging task in software maintenance. Existing approaches struggle to efficiently navigate complex codebases when identifying relevant code sections. The challenge lies in bridging natural language problem descriptions with the appropriate code elements, often requiring reasoning across hierarchical structures and multiple dependencies. The study introduces LocAgent, a framework that addresses code localization through graph-based representation. By parsing codebases into directed heterogeneous graphs, LocAgent creates a lightweight representation that captures code structures (files, classes, functions) and their dependencies (imports, invocations, inheritance), enabling LLM agents to effectively search and locate relevant entities through powerful multi-hop reasoning. Experimental results on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that the approach significantly enhances accuracy in code localization. Notably, the method with the fine-tuned Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct-32B model achieves comparable results to SOTA proprietary models at greatly reduced cost (approximately 86% reduction), reaching up to 92.7% accuracy on file-level localization while improving downstream GitHub issue resolution success rates by 12% for multiple attempts (Pass@10). The code is available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/LocAgent. <br> <br>

11. ***Search-R1 Trains LLMs to Reason and Utilize Search Engines via Reinforcement Learning.  <br>Researchers from UIUC and UMA have introduced Search-R1, an extension of the DeepSeek-R1 model that learns to autonomously generate search queries during reasoning using reinforcement learning. This approach allows the LLM to acquire external, up-to-date information for improved reasoning and text generation without requiring extensive supervised data or complex tool-use training. Experiments on question-answering datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, showcasing the effectiveness of RL in enhancing retrieval-augmented reasoning.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 12, UIUC and UMA published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09516) “Search-R1 Training LLMs to Reason and Leverage Search Engines with Reinforcement Learning”. Efficiently acquiring external knowledge and up-to-date information is essential for effective reasoning and text generation in large language models (LLMs). Retrieval augmentation and tool-use training approaches where a search engine is treated as a tool lack complex multi-turn retrieval flexibility or require large-scale supervised data. Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities during inference to use search engines is not optimal, since the LLM does not learn how to optimally interact with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of the DeepSeek-R1 model where the LLM learns -- solely through reinforcement learning (RL) -- to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM rollouts with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 26% (Qwen2.5-7B), 21% (Qwen2.5-3B), and 10% (LLaMA3.2-3B) over SOTA baselines. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrieval-augmented reasoning. The code and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/Search-R1. <br> <br>

13. ***Block Diffusion Models Bridge Autoregressive and Diffusion Language Model Strengths.  <br>Cornell Tech, Stanford University, and Cohere have introduced block diffusion language models, a new class that combines the benefits of discrete denoising diffusion and autoregressive models. Block diffusion overcomes limitations of both approaches by supporting flexible-length generation and improving inference efficiency through KV caching and parallel token sampling. This approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among diffusion models on language modeling benchmarks and enables the generation of sequences of arbitrary length.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 12, Cornell Tech, Stanford Uni and Cohere published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09573) “Block Diffusion: Interpolating Between Autoregressive and Diffusion Language Models”. Diffusion language models offer unique benefits over autoregressive models due to their potential for parallelized generation and controllability, yet they lag in likelihood modeling and are limited to fixed-length generation. This study introduces a class of block diffusion language models that interpolate between discrete denoising diffusion and autoregressive models. Block diffusion overcomes key limitations of both approaches by supporting flexible-length generation and improving inference efficiency with KV caching and parallel token sampling. The work proposes a recipe for building effective block diffusion models that includes an efficient training algorithm, estimators of gradient variance, and data-driven noise schedules to minimize the variance. Block diffusion sets a new state-of-the-art performance among diffusion models on language modeling benchmarks and enables generation of arbitrary-length sequences.

15. ***WritingBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Generative Writing in LLMs.  <br>Alibaba and collaborators have presented WritingBench, a new comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the generative writing capabilities of large language models. This benchmark assesses LLMs across six core writing domains and 100 subdomains, covering various writing styles. The study also proposes a query-dependent evaluation framework with a fine-tuned critic model for criteria-aware scoring, enabling more nuanced evaluations of style, format, and length. The benchmark and evaluation tools are open-sourced to advance LLM development in writing.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 11, Alibaba et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05244) “WritingBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Generative Writing”. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced text generation capabilities, yet evaluating their performance in generative writing remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on generic text generation or limited in writing tasks, failing to capture the diverse requirements of high-quality written contents across various domains. To bridge this gap, the study presents WritingBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs across 6 core writing domains and 100 subdomains, encompassing creative, persuasive, informative, and technical writing. The study further proposes a query-dependent evaluation framework that empowers LLMs to dynamically generate instance-specific assessment criteria. This framework is complemented by a fine-tuned critic model for criteria-aware scoring, enabling evaluations in style, format and length. The framework's validity is further demonstrated by its data curation capability, which enables 7B-parameter models to approach state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. The authors open-source the benchmark, along with evaluation tools and modular framework components, to advance the development of LLMs in writing. <br> <br>

17. ***Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Optimizes Test-Time Compute for LLM Reasoning.  <br>Researchers from CUM and Hugging Face have formalized the problem of optimizing test-time compute for LLM reasoning as a meta-reinforcement learning problem. They introduce Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (MRT), a new class of fine-tuning methods that aims to minimize cumulative regret over output tokens, balancing exploration and exploitation during inference. MRT demonstrates a 2-3x relative gain in performance and a 1.5x gain in token efficiency for math reasoning compared to standard outcome-reward RL.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 10, CUM and Huggingface published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07572) “Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning”. Training models to effectively use test-time compute is crucial for improving the reasoning performance of LLMs. Current methods mostly do so via fine-tuning on search traces or running RL with 0/1 outcome reward, but do these approaches efficiently utilize test-time compute? Would these approaches continue to scale as the budget improves? The work tries to answer these questions. The study formalizes the problem of optimizing test-time compute as a meta-reinforcement learning (RL) problem, which provides a principled perspective on spending test-time compute. This perspective enables to view the long output stream from the LLM as consisting of several episodes run at test time and leads to use a notion of cumulative regret over output tokens as a way to measure the efficacy of test-time compute. Akin to how RL algorithms can best tradeoff exploration and exploitation over training, minimizing cumulative regret would also provide the best balance between exploration and exploitation in the token stream. While the study shows that state-of-the-art models do not minimize regret, one can do so by maximizing a dense reward bonus in conjunction with the outcome 0/1 reward RL. This bonus is the ''progress'' made by each subsequent block in the output stream, quantified by the change in the likelihood of eventual success. Using these insights, the study develops Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning, or MRT, a new class of fine-tuning methods for optimizing test-time compute. MRT leads to a 2-3x relative gain in performance and roughly a 1.5x gain in token efficiency for math reasoning compared to outcome-reward RL. <br> <br>

19. ***Denoising Hamiltonian Network Improves Physical Reasoning in Machine Learning.  <br>MIT, CMU, and others have proposed the Denoising Hamiltonian Network (DHN), a novel framework that extends Hamiltonian mechanics operators into more flexible neural operators for physical reasoning. DHN captures non-local temporal relationships, mitigates numerical integration errors through denoising, and supports multi-system modeling. The framework's effectiveness and flexibility are demonstrated across three diverse physical reasoning tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 10, MIT, CMU, et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07596) “Denoising Hamiltonian Network for Physical Reasoning”. Machine learning frameworks for physical problems must capture and enforce physical constraints that preserve the structure of dynamical systems. Many existing approaches achieve this by integrating physical operators into neural networks. While these methods offer theoretical guarantees, they face two key limitations: (i) they primarily model local relations between adjacent time steps, overlooking longer-range or higher-level physical interactions, and (ii) they focus on forward simulation while neglecting broader physical reasoning tasks. The study proposes the Denoising Hamiltonian Network (DHN), a novel framework that generalizes Hamiltonian mechanics operators into more flexible neural operators. DHN captures non-local temporal relationships and mitigates numerical integration errors through a denoising mechanism. DHN also supports multi-system modeling with a global conditioning mechanism. The authors demonstrate its effectiveness and flexibility across three diverse physical reasoning tasks with distinct inputs and outputs.

21. ***DistiLLM-2 Uses Contrastive Learning to Enhance LLM Distillation. KAIST and Microsoft have introduced DistiLLM-2, a contrastive approach to boost the distillation of large language models. Unlike prior methods, DistiLLM-2 simultaneously increases the likelihood of teacher responses and decreases that of student responses, leveraging the synergy between loss formulations and data types. Experiments show that DistiLLM-2 creates high-performing student models across various tasks and supports applications like preference alignment and vision-language extensions.***
    Mar 10, KAIST and Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07067) “DistiLLM-2: A Contrastive Approach Boosts the Distillation of LLMs”. Despite the success of distillation in large language models (LLMs), most prior work applies identical loss functions to both teacher- and student-generated data. These strategies overlook the synergy between loss formulations and data types, leading to a suboptimal performance boost in student models. To address this, the study proposes DistiLLM-2, a contrastive approach that simultaneously increases the likelihood of teacher responses and decreases that of student responses by harnessing this synergy. Extensive experiments show that DistiLLM-2 not only builds high-performing student models across a wide range of tasks, including instruction-following and code generation, but also supports diverse applications, such as preference alignment and vision-language extensions. These findings highlight the potential of a contrastive approach to enhance the efficacy of LLM distillation by effectively aligning teacher and student models across varied data types. <br> <br>

23. ***YOLOE Achieves Real-Time "Seeing Anything" with Diverse Open Prompts.  <br>Tsinghua University has presented YOLOE, a highly efficient model that integrates object detection and segmentation across various open prompt mechanisms to achieve real-time "seeing anything." YOLOE incorporates strategies like Re-parameterizable Region-Text Alignment (RepRTA) for text prompts, Semantic-Activated Visual Prompt Encoder (SAVPE) for visual prompts, and Lazy Region-Prompt Contrast (LRPC) for prompt-free scenarios, demonstrating exceptional zero-shot performance, transferability, and high inference efficiency with low training costs.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 10, Tsinghua Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07465) “YOLOE: Real-Time Seeing Anything”. Object detection and segmentation are widely employed in computer vision applications, yet conventional models like YOLO series, while efficient and accurate, are limited by predefined categories, hindering adaptability in open scenarios. Recent open-set methods leverage text prompts, visual cues, or prompt-free paradigm to overcome this, but often compromise between performance and efficiency due to high computational demands or deployment complexity. This study introduces YOLOE, which integrates detection and segmentation across diverse open prompt mechanisms within a single highly efficient model, achieving real-time seeing anything. For text prompts, the study proposes Re-parameterizable Region-Text Alignment (RepRTA) strategy. It refines pretrained textual embeddings via a re-parameterizable lightweight auxiliary network and enhances visual-textual alignment with zero inference and transferring overhead. For visual prompts, the study presents Semantic-Activated Visual Prompt Encoder (SAVPE). It employs decoupled semantic and activation branches to bring improved visual embedding and accuracy with minimal complexity. For prompt-free scenario, the work introduces Lazy Region-Prompt Contrast (LRPC) strategy. It utilizes a built-in large vocabulary and specialized embedding to identify all objects, avoiding costly language model dependency. Extensive experiments show YOLOE's exceptional zero-shot performance and transferability with high inference efficiency and low training cost. Notably, on LVIS, with 3× less training cost and 1.4× inference speedup, YOLOE-v8-S surpasses YOLO-Worldv2-S by 3.5 AP. When transferring to COCO, YOLOE-v8-L achieves 0.6 APb and 0.4 APm gains over closed-set YOLOv8-L with nearly 4× less training time. Code and models are available at this https URL. <br> <br>

This model produces highly generalizable embeddings for text across numerous languages and modalities, including code. Evaluated on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB), Gemini Embedding significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models across multilingual, English, and code benchmarks.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 10, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07891) “Gemini Embedding Generalizable Embeddings from Gemini”. The work introduces Gemini Embedding, a state-of-the-art embedding model leveraging the power of Gemini, Google's most capable large language model. Capitalizing on Gemini's inherent multilingual and code understanding capabilities, Gemini Embedding produces highly generalizable embeddings for text spanning numerous languages and textual modalities. The representations generated by Gemini Embedding can be precomputed and applied to a variety of downstream tasks including classification, similarity, clustering, ranking, and retrieval. Evaluated on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB), which includes over one hundred tasks across 250+ languages, Gemini Embedding substantially outperforms prior state-of-the-art models, demonstrating considerable improvements in embedding quality. Achieving state-of-the-art performance across MMTEB's multilingual, English, and code benchmarks, the unified model demonstrates strong capabilities across a broad selection of tasks and surpasses specialized domain-specific models. <br> <br>

27. ***Research Explores Detection Avoidance Techniques for Large Language Models.  <br>A study by Bundeswehr University has investigated techniques to evade detection systems for large language models, which are crucial for identifying AI-generated fake news. Experiments demonstrate that simple manipulations like adjusting the generative model's temperature can fool shallow learning detectors. Fine-tuning with reinforcement learning can circumvent BERT-based detectors, and even rephrasing can evade zero-shot detectors like DetectGPT, highlighting vulnerabilities in current detection methods.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 10, Bundeswehr Uni. published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07595) “Detection Avoidance Techniques for Large Language Models”. The increasing popularity of large language models has not only led to widespread use but has also brought various risks, including the potential for systematically spreading fake news. Consequently, the development of classification systems such as DetectGPT has become vital. These detectors are vulnerable to evasion techniques, as demonstrated in an experimental series: Systematic changes of the generative models' temperature proofed shallow learning-detectors to be the least reliable. Fine-tuning the generative model via reinforcement learning circumvented BERT-based-detectors. Finally, rephrasing led to a >90\% evasion of zero-shot-detectors like DetectGPT, although texts stayed highly similar to the original. A comparison with existing work highlights the better performance of the presented methods. Possible implications for society and further research are discussed. <br> <br>

29. ***Collaboration and Memory Enhance Reasoning in Multi-Agent LLM Systems.  <br>Google researchers have explored a continuous collaborative learning system where groups of LLM agents work together on reasoning problems, utilizing a shared memory to improve performance over time. The study investigates the interoperability of different chain-of-thought reasoning styles, multi-agent collaboration strategies, and memory banks, revealing insights into how various methods contribute to reasoning performance on grounded tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 7, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05944) “Enhancing Reasoning with Collaboration and Memory”. The authors envision a continuous collaborative learning system where groups of LLM agents work together to solve reasoning problems, drawing on memory they collectively build to improve performance as they gain experience. This work establishes the foundations for such a system by studying the interoperability of chain-of-thought reasoning styles, multi-agent collaboration, and memory banks. Extending beyond the identical agents of self-consistency, the study introduces varied-context agents with diverse exemplars and a summarizer agent in place of voting. The study generates frozen and continuously learned memory banks of exemplars and pair them with fixed, random, and similarity-based retrieval mechanisms. The systematic study reveals where various methods contribute to reasoning performance of two LLMs on three grounded reasoning tasks, showing that random exemplar selection can often beat more principled approaches, and in some tasks, inclusion of any exemplars serves only to distract both weak and strong models. <br> <br>

31. ***BEHAVIOR Robot Suite Streamlines Real-World Whole-Body Manipulation for Household Tasks.  <br>Stanford University has introduced the BEHAVIOR Robot Suite (BRS), a comprehensive framework for enabling whole-body manipulation in household environments. BRS includes a bimanual, wheeled robot, a cost-effective teleoperation interface for data collection, and a novel algorithm for learning visuomotor policies. Evaluated on challenging household tasks, BRS demonstrates significant progress towards achieving real-world manipulation capabilities.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 7, Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05652) “BEHAVIOR Robot Suite: Streamlining Real-World Whole-Body Manipulation for Everyday Household Activities”. Real-world household tasks present significant challenges for mobile manipulation robots. An analysis of existing robotics benchmarks reveals that successful task performance hinges on three key whole-body control capabilities: bimanual coordination, stable and precise navigation, and extensive end-effector reachability. Achieving these capabilities requires careful hardware design, but the resulting system complexity further complicates visuomotor policy learning. To address these challenges, the study introduces the BEHAVIOR Robot Suite (BRS), a comprehensive framework for whole-body manipulation in diverse household tasks. Built on a bimanual, wheeled robot with a 4-DoF torso, BRS integrates a cost-effective whole-body teleoperation interface for data collection and a novel algorithm for learning whole-body visuomotor policies. The study evaluates BRS on five challenging household tasks that not only emphasize the three core capabilities but also introduce additional complexities, such as long-range navigation, interaction with articulated and deformable objects, and manipulation in confined spaces. The authors believe that BRS's integrated robotic embodiment, data collection interface, and learning framework mark a significant step toward enabling real-world whole-body manipulation for everyday household tasks.

33. ***R1-Searcher Incentivizes Search Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning.  <br>Renmin University has proposed R1-Searcher, a two-stage outcome-based reinforcement learning approach to enhance the search capabilities of large language models. This method allows LLMs to autonomously use external search systems during reasoning for time-sensitive or knowledge-intensive questions. Experiments show that R1-Searcher significantly outperforms previous retrieval-augmented generation methods*** <br> <br>
    Mar 7, Renmin Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05592) “R1-Searcher: Incentivizing the Search Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning”. Existing Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the complex reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models~(LLMs). While they achieve remarkable performance on challenging tasks such as mathematics and coding, they often rely on their internal knowledge to solve problems, which can be inadequate for time-sensitive or knowledge-intensive questions, leading to inaccuracies and hallucinations. To address this, the study proposes R1-Searcher, a novel two-stage outcome-based RL approach designed to enhance the search capabilities of LLMs. This method allows LLMs to autonomously invoke external search systems to access additional knowledge during the reasoning process. The framework relies exclusively on RL, without requiring process rewards or distillation for a cold start. Experiments demonstrate that the method significantly outperforms previous strong RAG methods, even when compared to the closed-source GPT-4o-mini. The code is available at https://github.com/SsmallSong/R1-Searcher. <br> <br>

35. ***R1-Zero Achieves "Aha Moment" in Visual Reasoning with a Small Non-SFT Model.  <br>UCLA researchers have successfully replicated the emergent "aha moment" of complex reasoning, previously seen in DeepSeek R1, for multimodal reasoning using a 2B non-SFT model. By applying reinforcement learning directly on the SAT dataset with Qwen2-VL-2B, the model achieved significant accuracy improvements on CVBench, demonstrating the potential for autonomous development of visual reasoning capabilities in smaller models.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 7, UCLA published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05132) “R1-Zero's "Aha Moment" in Visual Reasoning on a 2B Non-SFT Model”. Recently DeepSeek R1 demonstrated how reinforcement learning with simple rule-based incentives can enable autonomous development of complex reasoning in large language models, characterized by the "aha moment", in which the model manifest self-reflection and increased response length during training. However, attempts to extend this success to multimodal reasoning often failed to reproduce these key characteristics. This study presents the first successful replication of these emergent characteristics for multimodal reasoning on only a non-SFT 2B model. Starting with Qwen2-VL-2B and applying reinforcement learning directly on the SAT dataset, the model achieves 59.47% accuracy on CVBench, outperforming the base model by approximately ~30% and exceeding both SFT setting by ~2%. In addition, the authors share the failed attempts and insights in attempting to achieve R1-like reasoning using RL with instruct models. aiming to shed light on the challenges involved. The key observations include: (1) applying RL on instruct model often results in trivial reasoning trajectories, and (2) naive length reward are ineffective in eliciting reasoning capabilities.

37. ***Study Reveals Vulnerabilities of Mixture of LLM Agents to Deceptive Agents.  <br>UCL researchers have conducted the first comprehensive study on the robustness of Mixture of Large Language Model Agents (MoA) against deceptive agents. The study found that even a single carefully instructed deceptive agent can significantly reduce the performance of MoA architectures on benchmarks like AlpacaEval 2.0 and QuALITY, highlighting critical vulnerabilities. The study also proposes unsupervised defense mechanisms to mitigate this issue.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 7, UCL published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05856) “This Is Your Doge, If It Please You: Exploring Deception and Robustness in Mixture of LLMs”. Mixture of large language model (LLMs) Agents (MoA) architectures achieve state-of-the-art performance on prominent benchmarks like AlpacaEval 2.0 by leveraging the collaboration of multiple LLMs at inference time. Despite these successes, an evaluation of the safety and reliability of MoA is missing. The study presents the first comprehensive study of MoA's robustness against deceptive LLM agents that deliberately provide misleading responses. The study examines factors like the propagation of deceptive information, model size, and information availability, and uncover critical vulnerabilities. On AlpacaEval 2.0, the popular LLaMA 3.1-70B model achieves a length-controlled Win Rate (LC WR) of 49.2% when coupled with 3-layer MoA (6 LLM agents). However, the study demonstrates that introducing only a single carefully-instructed deceptive agent into the MoA can reduce performance to 37.9%, effectively nullifying all MoA gains. On QuALITY, a multiple-choice comprehension task, the impact is also severe, with accuracy plummeting by a staggering 48.5%. Inspired in part by the historical Doge of Venice voting process, designed to minimize influence and deception, the study proposes a range of unsupervised defense mechanisms that recover most of the lost performance. <br> <br>

39. ***AI Search Engines Face Significant Citation and Accuracy Problems.  <br>A Columbia Journalism Review study has found that AI search engines, including ChatGPT and Gemini, exhibit incorrect information over 60% of the time. Even the most accurate model in the study, Perplexity AI, had a 37% error rate. The study emphasizes that these tools often mislead users, reduce traffic to original sources, and struggle with correct citation, frequently fabricating answers instead of admitting uncertainty.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 6, Columbia Journalism Review published an [article](https://www.cjr.org/tow_center/we-compared-eight-ai-search-engines-theyre-all-bad-at-citing-news.php) “AI Search Has A Citation Problem”. A study by the Columbia Journalism Review found that AI search engines, including OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini, are incorrect over 60% of the time. The most accurate model, Perplexity AI, still had a 37% error rate, while Elon Musk's Grok 3 was wrong 94% of the time. The study highlights that generative search tools often mislead users and reduce traffic to original sources. Despite well-documented issues with accuracy, tech companies continue to push AI search tools. The study also noted that these tools often fail to cite sources correctly and prefer to fabricate answers rather than admit ignorance. This poses significant challenges for information quality and the online media economy. <br> <br>

1. ***Nvidia's STORM Enhances Video-LLMs for Long Video Understanding:  <br>A new architecture called STORM (Spatiotemporal TOken Reduction for Multimodal LLMs) that improves video understanding by incorporating a temporal encoder leveraging the Mamba State Space Model to integrate temporal information into image tokens, enhancing reasoning capabilities and reducing computational demands. It achieves state-of-the-art results while reducing computation costs and decoding latency.*** <br> <br>
   Mar 6, Nvidia published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04130) “Token-Efficient Long Video Understanding for Multimodal LLMs”. Recent advances in video-based multimodal large language models (Video-LLMs) have significantly improved video understanding by processing videos as sequences of image frames. However, many existing methods treat frames independently in the vision backbone, lacking explicit temporal modeling, which limits their ability to capture dynamic patterns and efficiently handle long videos. To address these limitations, the study introduces STORM (Spatiotemporal TOken Reduction for Multimodal LLMs), a novel architecture incorporating a dedicated temporal encoder between the image encoder and the LLM. The temporal encoder leverages the Mamba State Space Model to integrate temporal information into image tokens, generating enriched representations that preserve inter-frame dynamics across the entire video sequence. This enriched encoding not only enhances video reasoning capabilities but also enables effective token reduction strategies, including test-time sampling and training-based temporal and spatial pooling, substantially reducing computational demands on the LLM without sacrificing key temporal information. By integrating these techniques, the approach simultaneously reduces training and inference latency while improving performance, enabling efficient and robust video understanding over extended temporal contexts. Extensive evaluations show that STORM achieves state-of-the-art results across various long video understanding benchmarks (more than 5\% improvement on MLVU and LongVideoBench) while reducing the computation costs by up to 8times and the decoding latency by 2.4-2.9times for the fixed numbers of input frames.

The industry involves many AI applications from battery to aerospace.*** <br> <br>
   Mar 6, according to [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/06/google-co-founder-larry-page-reportedly-has-a-new-ai-startup/), Google co-founder Larry Page reportedly has a new AI startup. Google co-founder Larry Page is building a new company called Dynatomics that’s focused on applying AI to product manufacturing, according to The Information. Page is reportedly working with a small group of engineers on AI that can create “highly optimized” designs for objects and then have a factory build them, per The Information. Chris Anderson, previously the CTO of Page-backed electric airplane startup Kittyhawk, is running the stealth effort. Page isn’t the only entrepreneur exploring ways AI could be used to improve manufacturing processes (although he might be one of the richest). Orbital Materials is creating an AI platform that can be used to discover materials ranging from batteries to carbon dioxide-capturing cells. PhysicsX provides tools to run simulations for engineers working on project areas like automotive, aerospace, and materials science. Elsewhere, Instrumental is leveraging vision-powered AI to detect factory anomalies. <br> <br>

5. ***New Scaling Law for Long-Context LLMs:  <br>A bipartite mutual information scaling law in natural language, called L^2M, which governs long-range dependencies and relates a model's capacity for long context length modeling to the scaling of its latent state size. This provides a theoretical foundation for developing LLMs with longer context lengths.*** <br> <br>
   Mar 6, MIT, NSF AI, Harvard Uni, UCLA published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04725) “L^2M: Mutual Information Scaling Law for Long-Context Language Modeling”. The study rigorously establishes a bipartite mutual information scaling law in natural language that governs long-range dependencies. This scaling law, which the authors show is distinct from and scales independently of the conventional two-point mutual information, is the key to understanding long-context language modeling. Using this scaling law, the work formulates the Long-context Language Modeling (L^2M) condition, which relates a model's capacity for effective long context length modeling to the scaling of its latent state size for storing past information. Results are validated through experiments on both transformers and state space models. This work establishes a theoretical foundation that guides the development of large language models toward longer context lengths. <br> <br>

7. ***CMU Introduces Length-Controlled Reasoning in LLMs with Reinforcement Learning:  <br>Length Controlled Policy Optimization (LCPO), a reinforcement learning method that optimizes for accuracy and adherence to user-specified length constraints in reasoning language models. This allows for fine-grained allocation of test-time compute and accuracy, even surpassing GPT-4o in some cases.*** <br> <br>
   Mar 6, CMU published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04697) “L1: Controlling How Long A Reasoning Model Thinks With Reinforcement Learning”. Reasoning language models have shown an uncanny ability to improve performance at test-time by “thinking longer”-that is, by generating longer chain-of-thought sequences and hence using more compute. However, the length of their chain-of-thought reasoning is not controllable, making it impossible to allocate test-time compute to achieve a desired level of performance. The study introduces Length Controlled Policy Optimization (LCPO), a simple reinforcement learning method that optimizes for accuracy and adherence to user-specified length constraints. The study uses LCPO to train L1, a reasoning language model that produces outputs satisfying a length constraint given in its prompt. L1's length control allows for smoothly trading off computational cost and accuracy on a wide range of tasks, and outperforms the state-of-the-art S1 method for length control. Furthermore, the work uncovers an unexpected short chain-of-thought capability in models trained with LCPO. For instance, the 1.5B L1 model surpasses GPT-4o at equal reasoning lengths. Overall, LCPO enables precise control over reasoning length, allowing for fine-grained allocation of test-time compute and accuracy. Code and models: https://www.cmu-l3.github.io/l1 <br> <br>

9. ***Develops Feedback-Driven Inference Scaling for Open-Ended AI Tasks:  <br>By training dedicated Feedback and Edit Models that allow for Inference-Time Scaling for open-ended general-domain tasks. A model makes an initial response, gets feedback from a second model, and a third edits the response, reaching state-of-the-art performance on the Arena Hard benchmark by scaling optimally.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 6, Nvidia published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04378) “Dedicated Feedback and Edit Models Empower Inference-Time Scaling for Open-Ended General-Domain Tasks”. Inference-Time Scaling has been critical to the success of recent models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1. However, many techniques used to train models for inference-time scaling require tasks to have answers that can be verified, limiting their application to domains such as math, coding and logical reasoning. The study takes inspiration from how humans make first attempts, ask for detailed feedback from others and make improvements based on such feedback across a wide spectrum of open-ended endeavors. To this end, the authors collect data for and train dedicated Feedback and Edit Models that are capable of performing inference-time scaling for open-ended general-domain tasks. In the setup, one model generates an initial response, which are given feedback by a second model, that are then used by a third model to edit the response. The work shows that performance on Arena Hard, a benchmark strongly predictive of Chatbot Arena Elo can be boosted by scaling the number of initial response drafts, effective feedback and edited responses. When scaled optimally, the setup based on 70B models from the Llama 3 family can reach SoTA performance on Arena Hard at 92.7 as of 5 Mar 2025, surpassing OpenAI o1-preview-2024-09-12 with 90.4 and DeepSeek R1 with 92.3. <br> <br>

11. ***ACM Turing Award Honors Reinforcement Learning Pioneers:  <br>Andrew G. Barto and Richard S. Sutton for their groundbreaking contributions to reinforcement learning (RL), particularly their establishment of the conceptual and algorithmic framework that has led to recent AI successes like AlphaGo and ChatGPT.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 5, ACM [announced](https://awards.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/press-releases/2025/march/turing-award-2024.pdf) 2024 Turing Awards. The 2024 ACM A.M. Turing Award, often called the "Nobel Prize in Computing," has been awarded to Andrew G. Barto and Richard S. Sutton for their groundbreaking contributions to reinforcement learning (RL). Starting in the 1980s, Barto and Sutton established the conceptual and algorithmic framework for RL, a crucial approach in artificial intelligence where agents learn to optimize actions based on reward signals, drawing inspiration from psychology and neuroscience. Their key innovations include temporal difference learning, policy-gradient methods, and the use of neural networks within RL.  Their influential textbook further propelled the field, inspiring countless researchers. While their foundational algorithms are decades old, RL has recently achieved remarkable practical success through deep reinforcement learning, exemplified by AlphaGo's victory and ChatGPT's development, with applications now spanning robotics, optimization, and even neuroscience, demonstrating the profound and lasting impact of their multidisciplinary approach. ACM President Yannis Ioannidis and Google Chief Scientist Jeff Dean emphasized the enduring significance of Barto and Sutton's work, recognizing its pivotal role in the ongoing AI revolution and its potential for future advancements. <br> <br>

13. ***Design Choices Matter More Than Just Scaling for LLM Performance:  <br>The study meta-analyzes 92 open-source pretrained models to quantify the impact of various model design choices (beyond just size and training data) on downstream performance, finding that these choices can significantly improve predictive ability and revealing insights into data composition and architectural decisions.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 5, CMU et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03862) “Not-Just-Scaling Laws: Towards a Better Understanding of the Downstream Impact of Language Model Design Decisions”. Improvements in language model capabilities are often attributed to increasing model size or training data, but in some cases smaller models trained on curated data or with different architectural decisions can outperform larger ones trained on more tokens. What accounts for this? To quantify the impact of these design choices, the study meta-analyzes 92 open-source pretrained models across a wide array of scales, including state-of-the-art open-weights models as well as less performant models and those with less conventional design decisions. The study finds that by incorporating features besides model size and number of training tokens, the study can achieves a relative 3-28% increase in ability to predict downstream performance compared with using scale alone. Analysis of model design decisions reveal insights into data composition, such as the trade-off between language and code tasks at 15-25\% code, as well as the better performance of some architectural decisions such as choosing rotary over learned embeddings. Broadly, the framework lays a foundation for more systematic investigation of how model development choices shape final capabilities. <br> <br>

15. ***Superintelligence Strategy Proposes "Mutual Assured AI Malfunction" Deterrence:  <br>A "Superintelligence Strategy" centered around the concept of Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM) for deterrence, alongside nonproliferation to keep AI weapons out of rogue actor hands and bolstering economic and military competitiveness using AI.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 5, Nationalsecurity.ai published a [paper](https://www.nationalsecurity.ai/) “Superintelligence Strategy”. Rapid advances in AI are beginning to reshape national security. Destabilizing AI developments could rupture the balance of power and raise the odds of great-power conflict, while widespread proliferation of capable AI hackers and virologists would lower barriers for rogue actors to cause catastrophe. Superintelligence—AI vastly better than humans at nearly all cognitive tasks—is now anticipated by AI researchers. Just as nations once developed nuclear strategies to secure their survival, USA now needs a coherent superintelligence strategy to navigate a new period of transformative change. The article introduces the concept of Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM): a deterrence regime resembling nuclear mutual assured destruction (MAD) where any state’s aggressive bid for unilateral AI dominance is met with preventive sabotage by rivals. Given the relative ease of sabotaging a destabilizing AI project—through interventions ranging from covert cyberattacks to potential kinetic strikes on datacenters—MAIM already describes the strategic picture AI superpowers find themselves in. Alongside this, states can engage in nonproliferation to rogue actors to keep weaponizable AI capabilities out of their hands, and they can increase their competitiveness by bolstering their economies and militaries through AI. Taken together, the three-part framework of deterrence, nonproliferation, and competitiveness outlines a robust strategy to superintelligence in the years ahead. <br> <br>

Google has announced significant upgrades to its popular AI Overviews feature and launched a new experimental tool called AI Mode, both powered by the advanced Gemini 2.0 AI model. Google’s AI Overviews, already used by more than a billion people, are now integrated with Gemini 2.0, providing faster, more accurate responses. This update significantly improves handling challenging queries in coding, advanced mathematics, and multimodal questions involving various data types like text and images. AI Overviews are now more broadly accessible as well, with availability expanded to teens and removal of the requirement to sign in. AI Mode significantly simplifies the search experience, reducing the need for multiple queries and interactions. By combining Gemini 2.0’s advanced reasoning capabilities with Google's expansive information resources—including real-time data from the Knowledge Graph and shopping platforms—AI Mode allows for deeper exploration and more intuitive information discovery. The cost of usage is USD33/month. <br> <br>

They also introduce TTRL, reinforcement learning on test problems at inference time, achieving state-of-the-art score on the MIT Integration Bee.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 5, Tufa Labs published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00735) “LADDER: Self-Improving LLMs Through Recursive Problem Decomposition”. The study introduces LADDER (Learning through Autonomous Difficulty-Driven Example Recursion), a framework which enables Large Language Models to autonomously improve their problem-solving capabilities through self-guided learning by recursively generating and solving progressively simpler variants of complex problems. Unlike prior approaches that require curated datasets or human feedback, LADDER leverages a model's own capabilities to generate easier question variants. The work demonstrates LADDER's effectiveness in the subject of mathematical integration, improving Llama 3.2 3B's accuracy from 1% to 82% on undergraduate-level problems and enabling Qwen2.5 7B Deepseek-R1 Distilled to achieve 73% on the MIT Integration Bee qualifying examination. The study also introduces TTRL (Test-Time Reinforcement Learning), where the authors perform reinforcement learning on variants of test problems at inference time. TTRL enables Qwen2.5 7B Deepseek-R1 Distilled to achieve a state-of-the-art score of 90% on the MIT Integration Bee qualifying examination, surpassing OpenAI o1's performance. These results show how self-directed strategic learning can achieve significant capability improvements without relying on architectural scaling or human supervision. <br> <br>

21. ***SoftMatcha: Semantic Pattern Matching for Billion-Scale Text Corpora:  <br>A novel algorithm for semantic pattern matching in billion-scale corpora by relaxing surface-level matching with word embeddings. It achieves efficient searches comparable in speed to surface-level string matching, but better semantic matching.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 5, NAIST, Kyoto Uni et al published a [paper](https://openreview.net/pdf/9e329d6d8d6b019a23e1bf6e565ba27894464c62.pdf) “SoftMatcha: A Soft and Fast Pattern Matcher for Billion-Scale Corpus Searches”. Researchers and practitioners in natural language processing and computational linguistics frequently observe and analyze the real language usage in large-scale corpora. For that purpose, they often employ off-the-shelf pattern-matching tools, such as grep, and keyword-in-context concordancers, which is widely used in corpus linguistics for gathering examples. Nonetheless, these existing techniques rely on surface-level string matching, and thus they suffer from the major limitation of not being able to handle orthographic variations and paraphrasing -- notable and common phenomena in any natural language. In addition, existing continuous approaches such as dense vector search tend to be overly coarse, often retrieving texts that are unrelated but share similar topics. Given these challenges, the study proposes a novel algorithm that achieves soft (or semantic) yet efficient pattern matching by relaxing a surface-level matching with word embeddings. The algorithm is highly scalable with respect to the size of the corpus text utilizing inverted indexes. The authors have prepared an efficient [implementation](https://github.com/softmatcha/softmatcha) and provided an accessible web tool. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method (i) can execute searches on billion-scale corpora in less than a second, which is comparable in speed to surface-level string matching and dense vector search; (ii) can extract harmful instances that semantically match queries from a large set of English and Japanese Wikipedia articles; and (iii) can be effectively applied to corpus-linguistic analyses of Latin, a language with highly diverse inflections. <br> <br>

23. ***Stanford Presents UVA:  <br>A Unified Video Action model (UVA) that jointly optimizes video and action predictions to achieve both high accuracy and efficient action inference for robotics tasks. The design allow one model to tackle diverse tasks beyond policy learning.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 4, Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00200) “Unified Video Action Model”. A unified video and action model holds significant promise for robotics, where videos provide rich scene information for action prediction, and actions provide dynamics information for video prediction. However, effectively combining video generation and action prediction remains challenging, and current video generation-based methods struggle to match the performance of direct policy learning in action accuracy and inference speed. To bridge this gap, the work introduces the Unified Video Action model (UVA), which jointly optimizes video and action predictions to achieve both high accuracy and efficient action inference. The key lies in learning a joint video-action latent representation and decoupling video-action decoding. The joint latent representation bridges the visual and action domains, effectively modeling the relationship between video and action sequences. Meanwhile, the decoupled decoding, powered by two lightweight diffusion heads, enables high-speed action inference by bypassing video generation during inference. Such a unified framework further enables versatile functionality through masked input training. By selectively masking actions or videos, a single model can tackle diverse tasks beyond policy learning, such as forward and inverse dynamics modeling and video generation. Via an extensive set of experiments, the study demonstrates that UVA can serve as a general-purpose solution for a wide range of robotics tasks, such as policy learning, forward/inverse dynamics and video observation prediction, without compromising performance compared to methods tailored for specific applications.

25. ***Google Adapts Gemma:  <br>A study adapts the powerful Gemma decoder model to an encoder architecture (Gemma Encoder) to unlock its potential for a wider range of non-generative applications, demonstrating its effectiveness on GLUE and MS MARCO.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 4, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02656) “Adapting Decoder-Based Language Models for Diverse Encoder Downstream Tasks”. Decoder-based transformers, while revolutionizing language modeling and scaling to immense sizes, have not completely overtaken encoder-heavy architectures in natural language processing. Specifically, encoder-only models remain dominant in tasks like classification, regression, and ranking. This is primarily due to the inherent structure of decoder-based models, which limits their direct applicability to these tasks. This study introduces Gemma Encoder, adapting the powerful Gemma decoder model to an encoder architecture, thereby unlocking its potential for a wider range of non-generative applications. To optimize the adaptation from decoder to encoder, the study systematically analyzes various pooling strategies, attention mechanisms, and hyperparameters (e.g., dropout rate). Furthermore, the authors benchmark Gemma Encoder against established approaches on the GLUE benchmarks, and MS MARCO ranking benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility. <br> <br>

27. ***AI Scientist "Carl" Authors Peer-Reviewed Papers:  <br>An AI system capable of crafting academic research papers that pass rigorous double-blind peer-review processes, marking a significant milestone for AI-driven scientific discovery at ICLR.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 3, artificialintelligence-new published an [article](https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/autoscience-carl-the-first-ai-scientist-writing-peer-reviewed-papers/) “Autoscience Carl: The first AI scientist writing peer-reviewed paper”. The Autoscience Institute has introduced Carl, an AI system capable of crafting academic research papers that pass rigorous double-blind peer-review processes. Carl's papers were accepted in the Tiny Papers track at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), marking a significant milestone for AI-driven scientific discovery. Carl functions as an "automated research scientist," leveraging natural language models to ideate, hypothesize, and cite academic work accurately. It can read and comprehend published papers in seconds, work continuously, and accelerate research cycles while reducing costs. Carl's workflow involves ideation and hypothesis formation, experimentation, and presentation, with human involvement required for greenlighting research steps, citations, formatting, and assistance with pre-API models. The Autoscience team ensures Carl's work meets high standards of academic integrity through reproducibility, originality checks, and external validation. While Carl's success raises questions about AI's role in academia, Autoscience believes that legitimate results should be added to the public knowledge base regardless of their origin. The institute aims to contribute to evolving standards for AI-generated research and plans to propose a dedicated workshop at NeurIPS 2025. As AI systems like Carl become collaborators in research, the academic community must adapt to ensure integrity, transparency, and proper attribution. Here is its tech report. <br> <br>

29. ***Forgetting Transformer (FoX) Improves Long-Context Language Modeling with Forget Gate:  <br>A forget gate into Transformers by down-weighting the unnormalized attention scores, leading to the Forgetting Transformer (FoX), which outperforms Transformers on long-context language modeling, length extrapolation, and short-context downstream tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Mar 3, Mila and MakerMaker AI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02130) “Forgetting Transformer: Softmax Attention with a Forget Gate”. An essential component of modern recurrent sequence models is the forget gate. While Transformers do not have an explicit recurrent form, the study shows that a forget gate can be naturally incorporated into Transformers by down-weighting the unnormalized attention scores in a data-dependent way. The study names this attention mechanism the Forgetting Attention and the resulting model the Forgetting Transformer (FoX). The study shows that FoX outperforms the Transformer on long-context language modeling, length extrapolation, and short-context downstream tasks, while performing on par with the Transformer on long-context downstream tasks. Moreover, it is compatible with the FlashAttention algorithm and does not require any positional embeddings. Several analyses, including the needle-in-the-haystack test, show that FoX also retains the Transformer's superior long-context capabilities over recurrent sequence models such as Mamba-2, HGRN2, and DeltaNet. The work also introduces a "Pro" block design that incorporates some common architectural components in recurrent sequence models and find it significantly improves the performance of both FoX and the Transformer. The code is available at https://github.com/zhixuan-lin/forgetting-transformer. <br> <br>

31. ***Neural Characteristic Function Matching (NCFM) for Efficient Dataset Distillation:  <br>Dataset distillation as a minmax optimization problem, introduce Neural Characteristic Function Discrepancy (NCFD), a metric for measuring distributional differences. Experiments showed it achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods while reducing GPU memory usage and increasing speed.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 28, Shanghai Jiao Tong Uni, HKUST and SAIL published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20653) “Dataset Distillation with Neural Characteristic Function A Minmax Perspective”. Dataset distillation has emerged as a powerful approach for reducing data requirements in deep learning. Among various methods, distribution matching-based approaches stand out for their balance of computational efficiency and strong performance. However, existing distance metrics used in distribution matching often fail to accurately capture distributional differences, leading to unreliable measures of discrepancy. This study reformulates dataset distillation as a minmax optimization problem and introduce Neural Characteristic Function Discrepancy (NCFD), a comprehensive and theoretically grounded metric for measuring distributional differences. NCFD leverages the Characteristic Function (CF) to encapsulate full distributional information, employing a neural network to optimize the sampling strategy for the CF's frequency arguments, thereby maximizing the discrepancy to enhance distance estimation. Simultaneously, the work minimizes the difference between real and synthetic data under this optimized NCFD measure. The approach, termed Neural Characteristic Function Matching (NCFM), inherently aligns the phase and amplitude of neural features in the complex plane for both real and synthetic data, achieving a balance between realism and diversity in synthetic samples. Experiments demonstrate that the method achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on both low- and high-resolution datasets. Notably, the study achieves a 20.5% accuracy boost on ImageSquawk. The method also reduces GPU memory usage by over 300× and achieves 20× faster processing speeds compared to state-of-the-art methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve lossless compression of CIFAR-100 on a single NVIDIA 2080 Ti GPU using only 2.3 GB of memory. <br> <br>

33. ***Sparse Activation Steering (SAS) Offers Interpretable LLM Behavior Control:  <br>Sparse activation steering (SAS), a method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to steer LLM behavior in sparse spaces. By isolating behavior-specific features through a contrastive prompt-pairing approach, the study defines a set of features that can selectively reinforce or suppress behaviors.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 28, Mila, Meta, Uni Montreal et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00177) “Steering Large Language Model Activations in Sparse Spaces”. A key challenge in AI alignment is guiding large language models (LLMs) to follow desired behaviors at test time. Activation steering, which modifies internal model activations during inference, offers a potential solution. However, prior work in dense activation spaces struggles with superposition, wherein multiple features become entangled, limiting interpretability and precise control. In contrast, sparse representations provide an untapped opportunity for more interpretable behavior modulation. This study introduces sparse activation steering (SAS), a method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to steer LLM behavior in sparse spaces. By isolating behavior-specific features through a contrastive prompt-pairing approach, the study defines a set of features that can selectively reinforce or suppress behaviors. Experiments on Gemma 2 LLMs show that SAS vectors enable nuanced behavioral modulation and finer-grained control. Furthermore, scaling SAEs improves monosemanticity of SAS vectors, suggesting more reliable and interpretable interventions. <br> <br>

35. ***Token-Level Ensembling Enables Combining LLMs with Different Vocabularies:  <br>An inference-time algorithm that allows for ensembling models with different vocabularies, without the need to learn additional parameters or alter the underlying models.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 28, Johns Hopkins Uni, Uni of Maryland and Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.21265) “Token-level Ensembling of Models with Different Vocabularies”. Model ensembling is a technique to combine the predicted distributions of two or more models, often leading to improved robustness and performance. For ensembling in text generation, the next token's probability distribution is derived from a weighted sum of the distributions of each individual model. This requires the underlying models to share the same subword vocabulary, limiting the applicability of ensembling, since many open-sourced models have distinct vocabularies. In research settings, experimentation or upgrades to vocabularies may introduce multiple vocabulary sizes. This paper proposes an inference-time only algorithm that allows for ensembling models with different vocabularies, without the need to learn additional parameters or alter the underlying models. Instead, the algorithm ensures that tokens generated by the ensembled models agree in their surface form. The authors apply this technique to combinations of traditional encoder-decoder models and decoder-only LLMs and evaluate on machine translation. In addition to expanding to model pairs that were previously incapable of token-level ensembling, the algorithm frequently improves translation performance over either model individually. <br> <br>

37. ***Chain-of-Thought Prompting Enables Transformers to Learn Multi-Step Gradient Descent:  <br>Transformers with CoT prompting can learn to perform multi-step gradient descent autoregressively, achieving near-exact recovery and generalizing on unseen data in the in-context learning of linear regression.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 28, Shanghai Jiaotong Uni and Princeton Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.21212) “Transformers Learn to Implement Multi-step Gradient Descent with Chain of Thought”. Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to significantly improve the performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly in arithmetic and reasoning tasks, by instructing the model to produce intermediate reasoning steps. Despite the remarkable empirical success of CoT and its theoretical advantages in enhancing expressivity, the mechanisms underlying CoT training remain largely unexplored. This work studies the training dynamics of transformers over a CoT objective on an in-context weight prediction task for linear regression. The study proves that while a one-layer linear transformer without CoT can only implement a single step of gradient descent (GD) and fails to recover the ground-truth weight vector, a transformer with CoT prompting can learn to perform multi-step GD autoregressively, achieving near-exact recovery. Furthermore, the study shows that the trained transformer effectively generalizes on the unseen data. With the technique, the study also shows that looped transformers significantly improve final performance compared to transformers without looping in the in-context learning of linear regression. Empirically, the work demonstrates that CoT prompting yields substantial performance improvements. <br> <br>

39. ***AI-Driven Data Management for LLM Pre-training Improves Performance:  <br>A Data Manager (DataMan) that uses LLMs to self-identify criteria that benefit its performance and then annotate a pre-training corpus. This leads to significant improvements in in-context learning, perplexity, and instruction-following ability.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 27, Zhejiang Uni and Alibaba published a [paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=eNbA8Fqir4) “DataMan: Data Manager for Pre-training Large Language Models”. The performance emergence of large language models (LLMs) driven by data scaling laws makes the selection of pre-training data increasingly important. However, existing methods rely on limited heuristics and human intuition, lacking comprehensive and clear guidelines. To address this, the study is inspired by “reverse thinking” -- prompting LLMs to self-identify which criteria benefit its performance. As its pre-training capabilities are related to perplexity (PPL), the study derives 14 quality criteria from the causes of text perplexity anomalies and introduce 15 common application domains to support domain mixing. The study trains a Data Manager (DataMan) to learn quality ratings and domain recognition from pointwise rating, and uses it to annotate a 447B token pre-training corpus with 14 quality ratings and domain type. Experiments validate the approach, using DataMan to select 30B tokens to train a 1.3B-parameter language model, demonstrating significant improvements in in-context learning (ICL), perplexity, and instruction-following ability over the state-of-the-art baseline. The best-performing model, based on the Overall Score l=5 surpasses a model trained with 50% more data using uniform sampling. The study continues pre-training with high-rated, domain-specific data annotated by DataMan to enhance domain-specific ICL performance and thus verify DataMan's domain mixing ability. The findings emphasize the importance of quality ranking, the complementary nature of quality criteria, and their low correlation with perplexity, analyzing misalignment between PPL and ICL performance. The study also thoroughly analyzed the pre-training dataset, examining its composition, the distribution of quality ratings, and the original document sources. <br> <br>

41. ***Single-Step Rewards for Multi-Turn Code Generation:  <br>A simple approach that solves multi-turn code generation using only single-step rewards. muCode iteratively trains both a generator to provide code solutions conditioned on multi-turn execution feedback and a verifier to score the newly generated code.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 27, Mila, Uni Montreal and Cornell Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20380) “Multi-Turn Code Generation Through Single-Step Rewards”. The study addresses the problem of code generation from multi-turn execution feedback. Existing methods either generate code without feedback or use complex, hierarchical reinforcement learning to optimize multi-turn rewards. The study proposes a simple yet scalable approach, muCode, that solves multi-turn code generation using only single-step rewards. The key insight is that code generation is a one-step recoverable MDP, where the correct code can be recovered from any intermediate code state in a single turn. muCode iteratively trains both a generator to provide code solutions conditioned on multi-turn execution feedback and a verifier to score the newly generated code. Experimental evaluations show that the approach achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art baselines. The work provides analysis of the design choices of the reward models and policy, and show the efficacy of muCode at utilizing the execution feedback.

43. ***General Reasoning in LLMs Requires Disentangling Knowledge and Learning Reasoning from Scratch:  <br>That General Reasoning Requires Learning to Reason from the Get-go, proposing disentangling knowledge and reasoning through pretraining to reason, using curriculum of synthetic tasks, and learning more generalizable reasoning functions.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 26, MIT and Harvard Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19402) “General Reasoning Requires Learning to Reason from the Get-go”. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive real-world utility, exemplifying artificial useful intelligence (AUI). However, their ability to reason adaptively and robustly -- the hallmarks of artificial general intelligence (AGI) -- remains fragile. While LLMs seemingly succeed in commonsense reasoning, programming, and mathematics, they struggle to generalize algorithmic understanding across novel contexts. The experiments with algorithmic tasks in esoteric programming languages reveal that LLM's reasoning overfits to the training data and is limited in its transferability. The study hypothesizes that the core issue underlying such limited transferability is the coupling of reasoning and knowledge in LLMs. To transition from AUI to AGI, the study proposes disentangling knowledge and reasoning through three key directions: (1) pretaining to reason using RL from scratch as an alternative to the widely used next-token prediction pretraining, (2) using a curriculum of synthetic tasks to ease the learning of a reasoning prior for RL that can then be transferred to natural language tasks, and (3) learning more generalizable reasoning functions using a small context window to reduce exploiting spurious correlations between tokens. Such a reasoning system coupled with a trained retrieval system and a large external memory bank as a knowledge store can overcome several limitations of existing architectures at learning to reason in novel scenarios. <br> <br>

45. ***Pre-training on Formal Languages Imparts Linguistic Biases to LLMs.  <br>Research explores how pretraining language models on formal languages can improve natural language acquisition. The study hypothesizes that effective transfer happens when the formal language both captures dependency structures in natural language and remains within the computational limitations of the model architecture*** <br> <br>
    Feb 26, NYU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19249) “Between Circuits and Chomsky: Pre-pretraining on Formal Languages Imparts Linguistic Biases”. Pretraining language models on formal languages can improve their acquisition of natural language, but it is unclear which features of the formal language impart an inductive bias that leads to effective transfer. Drawing on insights from linguistics and complexity theory, the study hypothesizes that effective transfer occurs when the formal language both captures dependency structures in natural language and remains within the computational limitations of the model architecture. Focusing on transformers, the study finds that formal languages with both these properties enable language models to achieve lower loss on natural language and better linguistic generalization compared to other languages. In fact, pre-pretraining, or training on formal-then-natural language, reduces loss more efficiently than the same amount of natural language. For a 1B-parameter language model trained on roughly 1.6B tokens of natural language, pre-pretraining achieves the same loss and better linguistic generalization with a 33% smaller token budget. The work also gives mechanistic evidence of cross-task transfer from formal to natural language: attention heads acquired during formal language pretraining remain crucial for the model's performance on syntactic evaluations.

1. ***Microsoft Introduces LongRoPE2:  <br>Microsoft's LongRoPE2 extends LLM context windows while preserving short-context performance, achieved through a hypothesis regarding RoPE dimension training, an evolutionary search-guided rescaling algorithm, and mixed context window training. It significantly extends LLaMA3-8B's context length with less data than other approaches.*** <br> <br>
   Feb 27, Microsoft published a [paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.20082) “LongRoPE2: Near-Lossless LLM Context Window Scaling”. LongRoPE2 is a novel approach that extends the effective context window of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to the target length, while preserving the performance on the original shorter context window. This is achieved by three contributions: (1) a hypothesis that insufficient training in higher RoPE dimensions contributes to the persistent out-of-distribution (OOD) issues observed in existing methods; (2) an effective RoPE rescaling algorithm that adopts evolutionary search guided by "needle-driven" perplexity to address the insufficient training problem; (3) a mixed context window training approach that fine-tunes model weights to adopt rescaled RoPE for long-context sequences while preserving the short-context performance with the original RoPE. Extensive experiments on LLaMA3-8B and Phi3-mini-3.8B across various benchmarks validate the hypothesis and demonstrate the effectiveness of LongRoPE2. Remarkably, LongRoPE2 extends LLaMA3-8B to achieve a 128K effective context length while retaining over 98.5% of short-context performance, using only 10B tokens -- 80x fewer than Meta's approach, which fails to reach the target effective context length. Code will be available at https://github.com/microsoft/LongRoPE. <br> <br>

3. ***OpenAI Releases GPT-4.5:  <br>OpenAI's GPT-4.5 is a more general-purpose model built on GPT-4o, trained with new supervision techniques alongside SFT and RLHF, with extensive safety evaluations showing no significant increase in safety risk compared to previous models. It offers more natural interactions, a broader knowledge base, and improved emotional intelligence. OpenAI is sharing GPT‑4.5 as a research preview to better understand its strengths and limitations.*** <br> <br>
   Feb 27, OpenAI released GPT-4.5 and published a [report](https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-4-5-system-card-2272025.pdf) “OpenAI GPT-4.5 System Card”. GPT‑4.5 is OpenAI’s largest and most knowledgeable model yet. Building on GPT‑4o, GPT‑4.5 scales pre-training further and is designed to be more general-purpose than the powerful STEM-focused reasoning models. It is trained by using new supervision techniques combined with traditional methods like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), similar to those used for GPT‑4o. OpenAI conducted extensive safety evaluations prior to deployment and did not find any significant increase in safety risk compared to existing models. Early testing shows that interacting with GPT‑4.5 feels more natural. Its broader knowledge base, stronger alignment with user intent, and improved emotional intelligence make it well-suited for tasks like writing, programming, and solving practical problems—with fewer hallucinations. OpenAI is sharing GPT‑4.5 as a research preview to better understand its strengths and limitations and still exploring its capabilities and is eager to see how people use it in ways it might not have expected. This system card outlines how OpenAI built and trained GPT‑4.5, evaluated its capabilities, and strengthened safety, following OpenAI’s safety process and Preparedness Framework. <br> <br>

5. ***Research Investigates Inductive Bias in Neural Networks:  <br>Researchers at Princeton, NYU, and Yale explored the impact of initial weights and architecture on the inductive biases of neural networks, finding that meta-learning can reduce performance differences across architectures, suggesting initial weights may be more influential than typically assumed, and that stronger inductive biases are necessary for robust generalization.*** <br> <br>
   Feb 27, Princeton Uni, NYU and Yale Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20237) “Teasing Apart Architecture and Initial Weights as Sources of Inductive Bias in Neural Networks”. Artificial neural networks can acquire many aspects of human knowledge from data, making them promising as models of human learning. But what those networks can learn depends upon their inductive biases -- the factors other than the data that influence the solutions they discover -- and the inductive biases of neural networks remain poorly understood, limiting the ability to draw conclusions about human learning from the performance of these systems. Cognitive scientists and machine learning researchers often focus on the architecture of a neural network as a source of inductive bias. This study explores the impact of another source of inductive bias -- the initial weights of the network -- using meta-learning as a tool for finding initial weights that are adapted for specific problems. The study evaluates four widely-used architectures -- MLPs, CNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers -- by meta-training 430 different models across three tasks requiring different biases and forms of generalization. The study finds that meta-learning can substantially reduce or entirely eliminate performance differences across architectures and data representations, suggesting that these factors may be less important as sources of inductive bias than is typically assumed. When differences are present, architectures and data representations that perform well without meta-learning tend to meta-train more effectively. Moreover, all architectures generalize poorly on problems that are far from their meta-training experience, underscoring the need for stronger inductive biases for robust generalization. <br> <br>

7. ***Meta and Waterloo Propose DRAMA:  <br>Meta and the University of Waterloo introduced DRAMA, a framework using LLMs to train smaller, generalizable dense retrievers. It uses pruned LLMs as backbones and trains on LLM-augmented data, demonstrating improved multilingual and long-context capabilities.*** <br> <br>
   Feb 26, Meta and Uni of Waterloo published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18460) “DRAMA: Diverse Augmentation from Large Language Models to Smaller Dense Retrievers”. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong effectiveness and robustness while fine-tuned as dense retrievers. However, their large parameter size brings significant inference time computational challenges, including high encoding costs for large-scale corpora and increased query latency, limiting their practical deployment. While smaller retrievers offer better efficiency, they often fail to generalize effectively with limited supervised fine-tuning data. This study introduces DRAMA, a training framework that leverages LLMs to train smaller generalizable dense retrievers. In particular, the study adopts pruned LLMs as the backbone and train on diverse LLM-augmented data in a single-stage contrastive learning setup. Experiments show that DRAMA offers better multilingual and long-context capabilities than traditional encoder-based retrievers, and achieves strong performance across multiple tasks and languages. These highlight the potential of connecting the training of smaller retrievers with the growing advancements in LLMs, bridging the gap between efficiency and generalization. <br> <br>

9. ***Google, ICL, and Stanford Introduce an AI Co-Scientist:  <br>Researchers from Google, ICL, and Stanford developed an AI co-scientist, built on Gemini 2.0, designed to generate novel scientific hypotheses, incorporating a generate, debate, and evolve approach, validated in biomedical areas like drug repurposing, target discovery, and bacterial evolution mechanisms, suggesting potential augmentation of scientific discovery.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 26, Google, ICL and Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18864) “Towards an AI co-scientist”. Scientific discovery relies on scientists generating novel hypotheses that undergo rigorous experimental validation. To augment this process, the study introduces an AI co-scientist, a multi-agent system built on Gemini 2.0. The AI co-scientist is intended to help uncover new, original knowledge and to formulate demonstrably novel research hypotheses and proposals, building upon prior evidence and aligned to scientist-provided research objectives and guidance. The system's design incorporates a generate, debate, and evolve approach to hypothesis generation, inspired by the scientific method and accelerated by scaling test-time compute. Key contributions include: (1) a multi-agent architecture with an asynchronous task execution framework for flexible compute scaling; (2) a tournament evolution process for self-improving hypotheses generation. Automated evaluations show continued benefits of test-time compute, improving hypothesis quality. While general purpose, the study focuses development and validation in three biomedical areas: drug repurposing, novel target discovery, and explaining mechanisms of bacterial evolution and anti-microbial resistance. For drug repurposing, the system proposes candidates with promising validation findings, including candidates for acute myeloid leukemia that show tumor inhibition in vitro at clinically applicable concentrations. For novel target discovery, the AI co-scientist proposed new epigenetic targets for liver fibrosis, validated by anti-fibrotic activity and liver cell regeneration in human hepatic organoids. Finally, the AI co-scientist recapitulated unpublished experimental results via a parallel in silico discovery of a novel gene transfer mechanism in bacterial evolution. These results, detailed in separate, co-timed reports, demonstrate the potential to augment biomedical and scientific discovery and usher an era of AI empowered scientists. <br> <br>

11. ***Michigan and Cisco Present Curie:  <br>University of Michigan and Cisco presented Curie, an AI agent framework for rigorous scientific experimentation, incorporating intra-agent reliability, inter-agent methodical control, and experiment knowledge to enhance interpretability, achieving significant improvements in answering experimental questions in computer science domains.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 26, Uni of Michigan and Cisco published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16069) “Curie: Toward Rigorous and Automated Scientific Experimentation with AI Agents”. Scientific experimentation, a cornerstone of human progress, demands rigor in reliability, methodical control, and interpretability to yield meaningful results. Despite the growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in automating different aspects of the scientific process, automating rigorous experimentation remains a significant challenge. To address this gap, the study proposes Curie, an AI agent framework designed to embed rigor into the experimentation process through three key components: an intra-agent rigor module to enhance reliability, an inter-agent rigor module to maintain methodical control, and an experiment knowledge module to enhance interpretability. To evaluate Curie, the work designs a novel experimental benchmark composed of 46 questions across four computer science domains, derived from influential research papers, and widely adopted open-source projects. Compared to the strongest baseline tested, the study achieves a 3.4times improvement in correctly answering experimental questions. Curie is open-sourced at https://github.com/Just-Curieous/Curie. <br> <br>

Announce NeoBERT:  <br>NeoBERT, a next-generation encoder, integrates state-of-the-art advancements in architecture, data, and pre-training to enhance bidirectional models, achieving state-of-the-art results on the MTEB benchmark with a compact parameter footprint.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 26, Chandar Research Lab, Mila et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19587) “NeoBERT: A Next-Generation BERT”. Recent innovations in architecture, pre-training, and fine-tuning have led to the remarkable in-context learning and reasoning abilities of large auto-regressive language models such as LLaMA and DeepSeek. In contrast, encoders like BERT and RoBERTa have not seen the same level of progress despite being foundational for many downstream NLP applications. To bridge this gap, the study introduces NeoBERT, a next-generation encoder that redefines the capabilities of bidirectional models by integrating state-of-the-art advancements in architecture, modern data, and optimized pre-training methodologies. NeoBERT is designed for seamless adoption: it serves as a plug-and-play replacement for existing base models, relies on an optimal depth-to-width ratio, and leverages an extended context length of 4,096 tokens. Despite its compact 250M parameter footprint, it achieves state-of-the-art results on the massive MTEB benchmark, outperforming BERT large, RoBERTa large, NomicBERT, and ModernBERT under identical fine-tuning conditions. In addition, the study rigorously evaluates the impact of each modification on GLUE and design a uniform fine-tuning and evaluation framework for MTEB. The authors release all [code](https://github.com/chandar-lab/NeoBERT), data, [checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/chandar-lab/NeoBERT), and training scripts to accelerate research and real-world adoption. <br> <br>

    Feb 26, Stanford Uni, Google and OpenAI published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19312) “FSPO: Few-Shot Preference Optimization of Synthetic Preference Data in LLMs Elicits Effective Personalization to Real Users”. Effective personalization of LLMs is critical for a broad range of user-interfacing applications such as virtual assistants and content curation. Inspired by the strong in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, the study proposes Few-Shot Preference Optimization (FSPO), which reframes reward modeling as a meta-learning problem. Under this framework, an LLM learns to quickly adapt to a user via a few labeled preferences from that user, constructing a personalized reward function for them. Additionally, since real-world preference data is scarce and challenging to collect at scale, the study proposes careful design choices to construct synthetic preference datasets for personalization, generating over 1M synthetic personalized preferences using publicly available LLMs. In particular, to successfully transfer from synthetic data to real users, the study finds it crucial for the data to exhibit both high diversity and coherent, self-consistent structure. The work evaluates FSPO on personalized open-ended generation for up to 1,500 synthetic users across three domains: movie reviews, pedagogical adaptation based on educational background, and general question answering, along with a controlled human study. Overall, FSPO achieves an 87% Alpaca Eval winrate on average in generating responses that are personalized to synthetic users and a 72% winrate with real human users in open-ended question answering. <br> <br>

17. ***University of Washington Surveys Scaling Law Fitting Techniques:  <br>A survey examines scaling law fitting techniques in deep learning, highlighting discrepancies in conclusions across studies, analyzing the impact of specific details on scaling study results, and proposing a checklist for authors to improve reproducibility in scaling law research.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 26, Uni of Washington published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18969) “(Mis)Fitting Scaling Laws A Survey of Scaling Law Fitting Techniques in Deep Learning”. Modern foundation models rely heavily on using scaling laws to guide crucial training decisions. Researchers often extrapolate the optimal architecture and hyper parameters settings from smaller training runs by describing the relationship between, loss, or task performance, and scale. All components of this process vary, from the specific equation being fit, to the training setup, to the optimization method. Each of these factors may affect the fitted law, and therefore, the conclusions of a given study. The study discusses discrepancies in the conclusions that several prior works reach, on questions such as the optimal token to parameter ratio. The authors augment this discussion with their own analysis of the critical impact that changes in specific details may effect in a scaling study, and the resulting altered conclusions. Additionally, the work surveys over 50 papers that study scaling trends: while 45 of these papers quantify these trends using a power law, most under-report crucial details needed to reproduce their findings. To mitigate this, the study proposes a checklist for authors to consider while contributing to scaling law research. <br> <br>

19. ***Meta, UC San Diego, and Rochester Review Code and Reasoning in LLMs:  <br>A survey investigates the interplay between code and reasoning in LLMs, exploring how code enhances reasoning through structure and execution, and how improved reasoning transforms code intelligence, identifying key challenges and future research directions to strengthen this synergy.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 26, Meta, UC San Diego, and Uni of Rochester published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19411) “Code to Think, Think to Code: A Survey on Code-Enhanced Reasoning and Reasoning-Driven Code Intelligence in LLMs”. In large language models (LLMs), code and reasoning reinforce each other: code offers an abstract, modular, and logic-driven structure that supports reasoning, while reasoning translates high-level goals into smaller, executable steps that drive more advanced code intelligence. This study examines how code serves as a structured medium for enhancing reasoning: it provides verifiable execution paths, enforces logical decomposition, and enables runtime validation. The study also explores how improvements in reasoning have transformed code intelligence from basic completion to advanced capabilities, enabling models to address complex software engineering tasks through planning and debugging. Finally, the authors identify key challenges and propose future research directions to strengthen this synergy, ultimately improving LLM's performance in both areas. <br> <br>

21. ***IIIT Hyderabad et al. Introduce the REFUTE Benchmark:  <br>Researchers introduced REFUTE, a benchmark to evaluate LMs' ability to falsify subtly incorrect solutions, using algorithmic problem-solving with automatically evaluated counterexamples, finding that current reasoning agents struggle to create counterexamples, highlighting the need for improved falsification capabilities.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 26, IIIT Hyderabad, ELLIS, MPIIS, and Uni of Tubingen published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19414) “Can Language Models Falsify? Evaluating Algorithmic Reasoning with Counterexample Creation”. There is growing excitement about the potential of Language Models (LMs) to accelerate scientific discovery. Falsifying hypotheses is key to scientific progress, as it allows claims to be iteratively refined over time. This process requires significant researcher effort, reasoning, and ingenuity. Yet current benchmarks for LMs predominantly assess their ability to generate solutions rather than challenge them. The study advocates for developing benchmarks that evaluate this inverse capability - creating counterexamples for subtly incorrect solutions. To demonstrate this approach, the authors start with the domain of algorithmic problem solving, where counterexamples can be evaluated automatically using code execution. Specifically, the study introduces REFUTE, a dynamically updating benchmark that includes recent problems and incorrect submissions from programming competitions, where human experts successfully identified counterexamples. The analysis finds that the best reasoning agents, even OpenAI o3-mini (high) with code execution feedback, can create counterexamples for only <9% of incorrect solutions in REFUTE, even though ratings indicate its ability to solve up to 48% of these problems from scratch. The authors hope the work spurs progress in evaluating and enhancing LMs' ability to falsify incorrect solutions - a capability that is crucial for both accelerating research and making models self-improve through reliable reflective reasoning. <br> <br>

23. ***MIT and Google Present Fractal Generative Models:  <br>MIT and Google proposed Fractal Generative Models, which modularize generative models into atomic generative modules, constructing self-similar architectures through recursive invocation, demonstrating strong performance on pixel-by-pixel image generation.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 25, MIT and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17437) “Fractal Generative Models”. Modularization is a cornerstone of computer science, abstracting complex functions into atomic building blocks. This research introduces a new level of modularization by abstracting generative models into atomic generative modules. Analogous to fractals in mathematics, the method constructs a new type of generative model by recursively invoking atomic generative modules, resulting in self-similar fractal architectures that called fractal generative models. As a running example, the study instantiates the fractal framework using autoregressive models as the atomic generative modules and examine it on the challenging task of pixel-by-pixel image generation, demonstrating strong performance in both likelihood estimation and generation quality. The authors hope this work could open a new paradigm in generative modeling and provide a fertile ground for future research.

25. ***Meta, UIUC, and CMU Introduce SWE-RL:  <br>SWE-RL is a reinforcement learning approach for enhancing LLM reasoning in software engineering, trained on open-source software evolution data, enabling Llama3-SWE-RL-70B to achieve state-of-the-art performance on SWE-bench Verified and showing generalized reasoning skills.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 25, Meta, UIUC, and CMU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18449) “SWE-RL: Advancing LLM Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning on Open Software Evolution”. The recent DeepSeek-R1 release has demonstrated the immense potential of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While DeepSeek-R1 and other follow-up work primarily focus on applying RL to competitive coding and math problems, this paper introduces SWE-RL, the first approach to scale RL-based LLM reasoning for real-world software engineering. Leveraging a lightweight rule-based reward (e.g., the similarity score between ground-truth and LLM-generated solutions), SWE-RL enables LLMs to autonomously recover a developer's reasoning processes and solutions by learning from extensive open-source software evolution data -- the record of a software's entire lifecycle, including its code snapshots, code changes, and events such as issues and pull requests. Trained on top of Llama 3, the resulting reasoning model, Llama3-SWE-RL-70B, achieves a 41.0% solve rate on SWE-bench Verified -- a human-verified collection of real-world GitHub issues. To the authors knowledge, this is the best performance reported for medium-sized (<100B) LLMs to date, even comparable to leading proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o. Surprisingly, despite performing RL solely on software evolution data, Llama3-SWE-RL has even emerged with generalized reasoning skills. For example, it shows improved results on five out-of-domain tasks, namely, function coding, library use, code reasoning, mathematics, and general language understanding, whereas a supervised-finetuning baseline even leads to performance degradation on average. Overall, SWE-RL opens up a new direction to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through reinforcement learning on massive software engineering data. <br> <br>

27. ***Stanford et al. Provide an Overview of LLMs for Statisticians:  <br>An overview explores potential contributions statisticians can make to the development of LLMs, focusing on uncertainty quantification, interpretability, fairness, and privacy, and considering potential roles for LLMs in statistical analysis to bridge AI and statistics.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 25, Stanford Uni, NUY, Meta, Uni of Penn, UC Berkeley, INRIA, and Rutgers Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17814) “An Overview of Large Language Models for Statisticians”. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools in artificial intelligence (AI), exhibiting remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks such as text generation, reasoning, and decision-making. While their success has primarily been driven by advances in computational power and deep learning architectures, emerging problems -- in areas such as uncertainty quantification, decision-making, causal inference, and distribution shift -- require a deeper engagement with the field of statistics. This paper explores potential areas where statisticians can make important contributions to the development of LLMs, particularly those that aim to engender trustworthiness and transparency for human users. Thus, the work focuses on issues such as uncertainty quantification, interpretability, fairness, privacy, watermarking and model adaptation. The study also considers possible roles for LLMs in statistical analysis. By bridging AI and statistics, the work aims to foster a deeper collaboration that advances both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of LLMs, ultimately shaping their role in addressing complex societal challenges. <br> <br>

29. ***OpenAI Releases Deep Research System Card:  <br>OpenAI released "Deep Research" a new agentic capability that conducts multi-step research on the internet for complex tasks and released a system card detailing how the system was built, tested and risks mitigated prior to launch.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 25, OpenAI [release](https://cdn.openai.com/deep-research-system-card.pdf) “Deep Research System Card”. Deep research is a new agentic capability that conducts multi-step research on the internet for complex tasks. The deep research model is powered by an early version of OpenAI o3 that is optimized for web browsing. Deep research leverages reasoning to search, interpret, and analyze massive amounts of text, images, and PDFs on the internet, pivoting as needed in reaction to information it encounters. It can also read files provided by the user and analyze data by writing and executing python code. OpenAI believes deep research will be useful to people across a wide range of situations. Before launching deep research and making it available to the Pro users, OpenAI conducted rigorous safety testing, Preparedness evaluations and governance reviews. it also ran additional safety testing to better understand incremental risks associated with deep research’s ability to browse the web, and added new mitigations. Key areas of new work included strengthening privacy protections around personal information that is published online, and training the model to resist malicious instructions that it may come across while searching the Internet. At the same time, the testing on deep research also surfaced opportunities to further improve the testing methods. OpenAI took the time before broadening the release of deep research to conduct further human probing and automated testing for select risks. Building on OpenAI’s established safety practices and Preparedness Framework, this system card provides more details on how OpenAI built deep research, learned about its capabilities and risks, and improved safety prior to launch. <br> <br>

31. ***Tsinghua and UC Berkeley Present SpargeAttn:  <br>SpargeAttn is a universal sparse and quantized attention mechanism designed to accelerate diverse models by using a two-stage online filter to predict and skip unnecessary matrix multiplications, significantly improving speed without sacrificing end-to-end performance.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 25, Tsinghua Uni and UC Berkeley published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18137) “SpargeAttn: Accurate Sparse Attention Accelerating Any Model Inference”. An efficient attention implementation is essential for large models due to its quadratic time complexity. Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. This work proposes SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. The method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage rapidly and accurately predicts the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, the work designs an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that the method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics.

33. ***Johns Hopkins Introduces Rank1:  <br>Rank1 is a reranking model trained to take advantage of test-time compute by distilling from reasoning language models, showing state-of-the-art performance on reasoning datasets, strong out-of-distribution performance, and explainable reasoning chains.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 25, Johns Hopkins Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18418) “Rank1: Test-Time Compute for Reranking in Information Retrieval”. The study introduces Rank1, the first reranking model trained to take advantage of test-time compute. Rank1 demonstrates the applicability within retrieval of using a reasoning language model (i.e. OpenAI's o1, Deepseek's R1, etc.) for distillation in order to rapidly improve the performance of a smaller model. The work gathers and open-sources a dataset of more than 600,000 examples of R1 reasoning traces from queries and passages in MS MARCO. Models trained on this dataset show: (1) state-of-the-art performance on advanced reasoning and instruction following datasets; (2) work remarkably well out of distribution due to the ability to respond to user-input prompts; and (3) have explainable reasoning chains that can be given to users or RAG-based systems. Further, the study demonstrates that quantized versions of these models retain strong performance while using less compute/memory. Overall, Rank1 shows that test-time compute allows for a fundamentally new type of explainable and performant reranker model for search. Code: https://github.com/orionw/rank1 <br> <br>

35. ***MIT, Stanford, Amazon, and UMD Propose MAPoRL:  <br>Multi-Agent Post-co-training for collaborative LLMs with Reinforcement Learning (MAPoRL) is introduced to improve collaboration between LLMs, using multi-turn discussions and a co-training reward based on correctness and persuasive discussion, demonstrating improved collaboration performance and generalization.***
    Feb 25, MIT, Stanford Uni, Amazon and UMD published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18439) “MAPoRL: Multi-Agent Post-Co-Training for Collaborative Large Language Models with Reinforcement Learning”. Leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs) to build collaborative multi-agentic workflows has demonstrated significant potential. However, most previous studies focus on prompting the out-of-the-box LLMs, relying on their innate capability for collaboration, which may not improve LLMs' performance as shown recently. This study introduces a new post-training paradigm MAPoRL (Multi-Agent Post-co-training for collaborative LLMs with Reinforcement Learning), to explicitly elicit the collaborative behaviors and further unleash the power of multi-agentic LLM frameworks. In MAPoRL, multiple LLMs first generate their own responses independently and engage in a multi-turn discussion to collaboratively improve the final answer. In the end, a MAPoRL verifier evaluates both the answer and the discussion, by assigning a score that verifies the correctness of the answer, while adding incentives to encourage corrective and persuasive discussions. The score serves as the co-training reward, and is then maximized through multi-agent RL. Unlike existing LLM post-training paradigms, MAPoRL advocates the co-training of multiple LLMs together using RL for better generalization. Accompanied by analytical insights, experiments demonstrate that training individual LLMs alone is insufficient to induce effective collaboration. In contrast, multi-agent co-training can boost the collaboration performance across benchmarks, with generalization to unseen domains. <br> <br>

37. ***Bengio et al. Argue for Scientist AI as a Safer Alternative:  <br>They propose Scientist AI, a non-agentic AI system focused on explaining the world from observations rather than taking actions, as a safer alternative to agency-driven AI, emphasizing its potential to assist scientific research and act as a guardrail against risky AI agents.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 24, Bengio from Mila, Uni de Montreal, UC Berkeley, ICL and McGill Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15657) “Superintelligent Agents Pose Catastrophic Risks: Can Scientist AI Offer a Safer Path?”. The leading AI companies are increasingly focused on building generalist AI agents -- systems that can autonomously plan, act, and pursue goals across almost all tasks that humans can perform. Despite how useful these systems might be, unchecked AI agency poses significant risks to public safety and security, ranging from misuse by malicious actors to a potentially irreversible loss of human control. The study discusses how these risks arise from current AI training methods. Indeed, various scenarios and experiments have demonstrated the possibility of AI agents engaging in deception or pursuing goals that were not specified by human operators and that conflict with human interests, such as self-preservation. Following the precautionary principle, the work see a strong need for safer, yet still useful, alternatives to the current agency-driven trajectory. Accordingly, the authors propose as a core building block for further advances the development of a non-agentic AI system that is trustworthy and safe by design, which is called Scientist AI. This system is designed to explain the world from observations, as opposed to taking actions in it to imitate or please humans. It comprises a world model that generates theories to explain data and a question-answering inference machine. Both components operate with an explicit notion of uncertainty to mitigate the risks of overconfident predictions. In light of these considerations, a Scientist AI could be used to assist human researchers in accelerating scientific progress, including in AI safety. In particular, the system can be employed as a guardrail against AI agents that might be created despite the risks involved. Ultimately, focusing on non-agentic AI may enable the benefits of AI innovation while avoiding the risks associated with the current trajectory. The authors hope these arguments will motivate researchers, developers, and policymakers to favor this safer path. <br> <br>

39. ***SynthLab and Stanford Uni Introduce Big-Math:  <br>Big-Math is a large-scale, high-quality math dataset of over 250,000 questions specifically designed for reinforcement learning, addressing the gap between data quality and quantity and providing a robust foundation for advancing reasoning in LLMs.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 24, SynthLab and Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17387) “Big-Math: A Large-Scale, High-Quality Math Dataset for Reinforcement Learning in Language Models”. Increasing interest in reasoning models has led math to become a prominent testing ground for algorithmic and methodological improvements. However, existing open math datasets either contain a small collection of high-quality, human-written problems or a large corpus of machine-generated problems of uncertain quality, forcing researchers to choose between quality and quantity. This study presents Big-Math, a dataset of over 250,000 high-quality math questions with verifiable answers, purposefully made for reinforcement learning (RL). To create Big-Math, the authors rigorously filter, clean, and curate openly available datasets, extracting questions that satisfy three desiderata: (1) problems with uniquely verifiable solutions, (2) problems that are open-ended, (3) and problems with a closed-form solution. To ensure the quality of Big-Math, the study manually verifies each step in the filtering process. Based on the findings from the filtering process, the work introduces 47,000 new questions with verified answers, Big-Math-Reformulated: closed-ended questions (i.e. multiple choice questions) that have been reformulated as open-ended questions through a systematic reformulation algorithm. Compared to the most commonly used existing open-source datasets for math reasoning, GSM8k and MATH, Big-Math is an order of magnitude larger, while the rigorous filtering ensures to maintain the questions most suitable for RL. The study also provides a rigorous analysis of the dataset, finding that Big-Math contains a high degree of diversity across problem domains, and incorporates a wide range of problem difficulties, enabling a wide range of downstream uses for models of varying capabilities and training requirements. By bridging the gap between data quality and quantity, Big-Math establish a robust foundation for advancing reasoning in LLMs. <br> <br>

41. ***CMU and North Carolina State Present PAPRIKA:  <br>PAPRIKA is a fine-tuning approach that enables language models to develop general decision-making capabilities, training on synthetic interaction data from diverse tasks to allow models to explore and adapt their behavior without further gradient updates.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 24, CMU and North Carolina State Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17543) “Training a Generally Curious Agent”. Efficient exploration is essential for intelligent systems interacting with their environment, but existing language models often fall short in scenarios that require strategic information gathering. This study presents PAPRIKA, a fine-tuning approach that enables language models to develop general decision-making capabilities that are not confined to particular environments. By training on synthetic interaction data from different tasks that require diverse strategies, PAPRIKA teaches models to explore and adapt their behavior on a new task based on environment feedback in-context without more gradient updates. Experimental results show that models fine-tuned with PAPRIKA can effectively transfer their learned decision-making capabilities to entirely unseen tasks without additional training. Unlike traditional training, the approach's primary bottleneck lies in sampling useful interaction data instead of model updates. To improve sample efficiency, the study proposes a curriculum learning strategy that prioritizes sampling trajectories from tasks with high learning potential. These results suggest a promising path towards AI systems that can autonomously solve novel sequential decision-making problems that require interactions with the external world. <br> <br>

43. ***Vrije Uni and Harvard Uni Analyze Reasoning and Performance:  <br>A study analyzes the relationship between reasoning and performance in large language models, finding that o3-mini achieves superior accuracy without longer reasoning chains and that accuracy declines as reasoning chains grow, suggesting more proficient models use test-time compute more effectively.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 24, Vrije Uni and Harvard Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15631) “The Relationship Between Reasoning and Performance in Large Language Models -- o3 (mini) Thinks Harder, Not Longer”. Large language models have demonstrated remarkable progress in mathematical reasoning, leveraging chain-of-thought and test-time compute scaling. However, many open questions remain regarding the interplay between reasoning token usage and accuracy gains. In particular, when comparing models across generations, it is unclear whether improved performance results from longer reasoning chains or more efficient reasoning. The work systematically analyzes chain-of-thought length across o1-mini and o3-mini variants on the Omni-MATH benchmark, finding that o3-mini (m) achieves superior accuracy without requiring longer reasoning chains than o1-mini. Moreover, the study shows that accuracy generally declines as reasoning chains grow across all models and compute settings, even when controlling for difficulty of the questions. This accuracy drop is significantly smaller in more proficient models, suggesting that new generations of reasoning models use test-time compute more effectively. Finally, the study highlights that while o3-mini (h) achieves a marginal accuracy gain over o3-mini (m), it does so by allocating substantially more reasoning tokens across all problems, even the ones that o3-mini (m) can already solve. These findings provide new insights into the relationship between model capability and reasoning length, with implications for efficiency, scaling, and evaluation methodologies. <br> <br>

45. ***Uni of Exeter et al. Introduce Stable-SPAM:  <br>Stable-SPAM enhances gradient normalization and clipping techniques to stabilize gradient norms in 4-bit LLM training, delivering superior performance compared to Adam and SPAM, and achieving comparable loss with fewer training steps.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 24, Uni of Exeter et al. published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17055) “Stable-SPAM: How to Train in 4-Bit More Stably than 16-Bit Adam”. This paper comprehensively evaluates several recently proposed optimizers for 4-bit training, revealing that low-bit precision amplifies sensitivity to learning rates and often causes unstable gradient norms, leading to divergence at higher learning rates. Among these, SPAM, a recent optimizer featuring momentum reset and spike-aware gradient clipping, achieves the best performance across various bit levels, but struggles to stabilize gradient norms, requiring careful learning rate tuning. To address these limitations, the work proposes Stable-SPAM, which incorporates enhanced gradient normalization and clipping techniques. In particular, Stable-SPAM (1) adaptively updates the clipping threshold for spiked gradients by tracking their historical maxima; (2) normalizes the entire gradient matrix based on its historical l_2-norm statistics; and (3) inherits momentum reset from SPAM to periodically reset the first and second moments of Adam, mitigating the accumulation of spiked gradients. Extensive experiments show that Stable-SPAM effectively stabilizes gradient norms in 4-bit LLM training, delivering superior performance compared to Adam and SPAM. Notably, the 4-bit LLaMA-1B model trained with Stable-SPAM outperforms the BF16 LLaMA-1B trained with Adam by up to 2 perplexity. Furthermore, when both models are trained in 4-bit, Stable-SPAM achieves the same loss as Adam while requiring only about half the training steps.

47. ***ByteDance Proposes COD for Downstream Performance Prediction:  <br>Clustering-On-Difficulty (COD) is a framework for predicting downstream task performance of LLMs by constructing a predictable support subset based on task difficulty features, achieving remarkable predictive accuracy with small models.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 24, ByteDance published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17262) “Unveiling Downstream Performance Scaling of LLMs: A Clustering-Based Perspective”. The rapid advancements in computing dramatically increase the scale and cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs). Accurately predicting downstream task performance prior to model training is crucial for efficient resource allocation, yet remains challenging due to two primary constraints: (1) the "emergence phenomenon", wherein downstream performance metrics become meaningful only after extensive training, which limits the ability to use smaller models for prediction; (2) Uneven task difficulty distributions and the absence of consistent scaling laws, resulting in substantial metric variability. Existing performance prediction methods suffer from limited accuracy and reliability, thereby impeding the assessment of potential LLM capabilities. To address these challenges, the study proposes a Clustering-On-Difficulty (COD) downstream performance prediction framework. COD first constructs a predictable support subset by clustering tasks based on difficulty features, strategically excluding non-emergent and non-scalable clusters. The scores on the selected subset serve as effective intermediate predictors of downstream performance on the full evaluation set. With theoretical support, the work derives a mapping function that transforms performance metrics from the predictable subset to the full evaluation set, thereby ensuring accurate extrapolation of LLM downstream performance. The proposed method has been applied to predict performance scaling for a 70B LLM, providing actionable insights for training resource allocation and assisting in monitoring the training process. Notably, COD achieves remarkable predictive accuracy on the 70B LLM by leveraging an ensemble of small models, demonstrating an absolute mean deviation of 1.36% across eight important LLM evaluation benchmarks. <br> <br>

Present AAD-LLM:  <br>Auditory Attention-Driven LLM (AAD-LLM) integrates brain signals to infer listener attention and refine responses accordingly, using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings to decode the attended speaker and improve alignment with listener intention in multitalker scenarios.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 24, MBZMBBI, Columbia Uni, NYU et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16794) “AAD-LLM: Neural Attention-Driven Auditory Scene Understanding”. Auditory foundation models, including auditory large language models (LLMs), process all sound inputs equally, independent of listener perception. However, human auditory perception is inherently selective: listeners focus on specific speakers while ignoring others in complex auditory scenes. Existing models do not incorporate this selectivity, limiting their ability to generate perception-aligned responses. To address this, the study introduces Intention-Informed Auditory Scene Understanding (II-ASU) and present Auditory Attention-Driven LLM (AAD-LLM), a prototype system that integrates brain signals to infer listener attention. AAD-LLM extends an auditory LLM by incorporating intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings to decode which speaker a listener is attending to and refine responses accordingly. The model first predicts the attended speaker from neural activity, then conditions response generation on this inferred attentional state. The study evaluates AAD-LLM on speaker description, speech transcription and extraction, and question answering in multitalker scenarios, with both objective and subjective ratings showing improved alignment with listener intention. By taking a first step toward intention-aware auditory AI, this work explores a new paradigm where listener perception informs machine listening, paving the way for future listener-centered auditory systems.

51. ***USC and Vrije Uni Investigate Perception of Small Visual Details in MLLMs:  <br>A study shows that MLLMs' performance in visual question answering is sensitive to the size of the visual subject and proposes training-free visual intervention methods using attention and gradient maps to enhance perception of small visual details.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 24, Uni of Southern California and Vrije Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17422) “MLLMs Know Where to Look: Training-free Perception of Small Visual Details with Multimodal LLMs”. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have experienced rapid progress in visual recognition tasks in recent years. Given their potential integration into many critical applications, it is important to understand the limitations of their visual perception. This work studies whether MLLMs can perceive small visual details as effectively as large ones when answering questions about images. The study observes that their performance is very sensitive to the size of the visual subject of the question, and further show that this effect is in fact causal by conducting an intervention study. Next, the authors study the attention patterns of MLLMs when answering visual questions, and intriguingly find that they consistently know where to look, even when they provide the wrong answer. Based on these findings, the study then proposes training-free visual intervention methods that leverage the internal knowledge of any MLLM itself, in the form of attention and gradient maps, to enhance its perception of small visual details. The study evaluates the proposed methods on two widely-used MLLMs and seven visual question answering benchmarks and show that they can significantly improve MLLMs' accuracy without requiring any training. The results elucidate the risk of applying MLLMs to visual recognition tasks concerning small details and indicate that visual intervention using the model's internal state is a promising direction to mitigate this risk. <br> <br>

53. ***Google and IST Austria Study Compression Scaling Laws:  <br>The study investigates how weight and activation quantization, and weight sparsity, affect the scaling behavior of LLMs during pretraining, demonstrating that these techniques can be unified under a common scaling law framework.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 23, Google and Inst of Sci&Tech Austria published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16440) “Compression Scaling Laws:Unifying Sparsity and Quantization”. The study investigates how different compression techniques -- such as weight and activation quantization, and weight sparsity -- affect the scaling behavior of large language models (LLMs) during pretraining. Building on previous work showing that weight sparsity acts as a constant multiplier on model size in scaling laws, the study demonstrates that this "effective parameter" scaling pattern extends to quantization as well. Specifically, the study establishes that weight-only quantization achieves strong parameter efficiency multipliers, while full quantization of both weights and activations shows diminishing returns at lower bitwidths. The results suggest that different compression techniques can be unified under a common scaling law framework, enabling principled comparison and combination of these methods. <br> <br>

55. ***Google and Arizona State Uni Present PlanGEN:  <br>PlanGEN is a model-agnostic agent framework with constraint, verification, and selection agents that enhances inference-time algorithms for complex planning problems, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 22, Google and Arizona State Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16111) “PlanGEN: A Multi-Agent Framework for Generating Planning and Reasoning Trajectories for Complex Problem Solving”. Recent agent frameworks and inference-time algorithms often struggle with complex planning problems due to limitations in verifying generated plans or reasoning and varying complexity of instances within a single task. Many existing methods for these tasks either perform task-level verification without considering constraints or apply inference-time algorithms without adapting to instance-level complexity. To address these limitations, the study proposes PlanGEN, a model-agnostic and easily scalable agent framework with three key components: constraint, verification, and selection agents. Specifically, the approach proposes constraint-guided iterative verification to enhance performance of inference-time algorithms--Best of N, Tree-of-Thought, and REBASE. In PlanGEN framework, the selection agent optimizes algorithm choice based on instance complexity, ensuring better adaptability to complex planning problems. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over the strongest baseline across multiple benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on NATURAL PLAN (sim8%uparrow), OlympiadBench (sim4%uparrow), DocFinQA (sim7%uparrow), and GPQA (sim1%uparrow). The key finding highlights that constraint-guided iterative verification improves inference-time algorithms, and adaptive selection further boosts performance on complex planning and reasoning problems. <br> <br>

    Feb 20, UIUC published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14767) “Tree-of-Debate: Multi-Persona Debate Trees Elicit Critical Thinking for Scientific Comparative Analysis”. With the exponential growth of research facilitated by modern technology and improved accessibility, scientific discoveries have become increasingly fragmented within and across fields. This makes it challenging to assess the significance, novelty, incremental findings, and equivalent ideas between related works, particularly those from different research communities. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong quantitative and qualitative reasoning abilities, and multi-agent LLM debates have shown promise in handling complex reasoning tasks by exploring diverse perspectives and reasoning paths. Inspired by this, the study introduces Tree-of-Debate (ToD), a framework which converts scientific papers into LLM personas that debate their respective novelties. To emphasize structured, critical reasoning rather than focusing solely on outcomes, ToD dynamically constructs a debate tree, enabling fine-grained analysis of independent novelty arguments within scholarly articles. Through experiments on scientific literature across various domains, evaluated by expert researchers, the work demonstrates that ToD generates informative arguments, effectively contrasts papers, and supports researchers in their literature review. <br> <br>

    Feb 19, The Hebrew Uni of Jerusalem published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15814) “Slamming: Training a Speech Language Model on One GPU in a Day”. The study introduces Slam, a recipe for training high-quality Speech Language Models (SLMs) on a single academic GPU in 24 hours. The word does so through empirical analysis of model initialisation and architecture, synthetic training data, preference optimisation with synthetic data and tweaking all other components. The study empirically demonstrates that this training recipe also scales well with more compute getting results on par with leading SLMs in a fraction of the compute cost. The authors hope these insights will make SLM training and research more accessible. In the context of SLM scaling laws, the results far outperform predicted compute optimal performance, giving an optimistic view to SLM feasibility.

1. ***Scaling LLM Evaluation:  <br>ByteDance's SuperGPQA paper introduces a benchmark assessing graduate-level knowledge across 285 disciplines, using a Human-LLM collaborative filtering mechanism. Experiments show current LLMs need significant improvement, underscoring the gap to artificial general intelligence. The paper also provides methodological insights from managing a large annotation process.*** <br> <br>
   Feb 21, ByteDance published a 256-page [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14739) “SuperGPQA: Scaling LLM Evaluation across 285 Graduate Disciplines”.
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in mainstream academic disciplines such as mathematics, physics, and computer science. However, human knowledge encompasses over 200 specialized disciplines, far exceeding the scope of existing benchmarks. The capabilities of LLMs in many of these specialized fields-particularly in light industry, agriculture, and service-oriented disciplines-remain inadequately evaluated. To address this gap, the study presents SuperGPQA, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates graduate-level knowledge and reasoning capabilities across 285 disciplines. The benchmark employs a novel Human-LLM collaborative filtering mechanism to eliminate trivial or ambiguous questions through iterative refinement based on both LLM responses and expert feedback. Experimental results reveal significant room for improvement in the performance of current state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse knowledge domains (e.g., the reasoning-focused model DeepSeek-R1 achieved the highest accuracy of 61.82% on SuperGPQA), highlighting the considerable gap between current model capabilities and artificial general intelligence. Additionally, the work presents comprehensive insights from the management of a large-scale annotation process, involving over 80 expert annotators and an interactive Human-LLM collaborative system, offering valuable methodological guidance for future research initiatives of comparable scope. <br> <br>

3. ***Multilingual Vision-Language Encoders:  <br>Google's SigLIP 2 paper presents improved multilingual vision-language encoders building on the original SigLIP. By unifying captioning-based pretraining, self-supervised losses, and online data curation, SigLIP 2 models achieve better performance in zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and transfer learning. The models also show enhancements in localization and fairness through diverse data mixing.*** <br> <br>
   Feb 21, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14786) “SigLIP 2: Multilingual Vision-Language Encoders with Improved Semantic Understanding, Localization, and Dense Features”. The study introduces SigLIP 2, a family of new multilingual vision-language encoders that build on the success of the original SigLIP. In this second iteration, the work extends the original image-text training objective with several prior, independently developed techniques into a unified recipe -- this includes captioning-based pretraining, self-supervised losses (self-distillation, masked prediction) and online data curation. With these changes, SigLIP 2 models outperform their SigLIP counterparts at all model scales in core capabilities, including zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and transfer performance when extracting visual representations for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Furthermore, the new training recipe leads to significant improvements on localization and dense prediction tasks. The study also trains variants which support multiple resolutions and preserve the input's native aspect ratio. Finally, the work trains on a more diverse data-mixture that includes de-biasing techniques, leading to much better multilingual understanding and improved fairness. To allow users to trade off inference cost with performance, the authors release model checkpoints at four sizes: ViT-B (86M), L (303M), So400m (400M), and g (1B). <br> <br>

It also introduces TrustGen, a dynamic benchmarking platform for evaluating trustworthiness across multiple dimensions and model types. Finally, it discusses challenges and future directions, including the release of the TrustEval-toolkit for dynamic evaluation.*** <br> <br>
   Feb 20, Uni of Notre Dame et al. published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14296) “On the Trustworthiness of Generative Foundation Models: Guideline, Assessment, and Perspective”. Generative Foundation Models (GenFMs) have emerged as transformative tools. However, their widespread adoption raises critical concerns regarding trustworthiness across dimensions. This paper presents a comprehensive framework to address these challenges through three key contributions. First, the authors systematically review global AI governance laws and policies from governments and regulatory bodies, as well as industry practices and standards. Based on this analysis, the work proposes a set of guiding principles for GenFMs, developed through extensive multidisciplinary collaboration that integrates technical, ethical, legal, and societal perspectives. Second, the study introduces TrustGen, the first dynamic benchmarking platform designed to evaluate trustworthiness across multiple dimensions and model types, including text-to-image, large language, and vision-language models. TrustGen leverages modular components--metadata curation, test case generation, and contextual variation--to enable adaptive and iterative assessments, overcoming the limitations of static evaluation methods. Using TrustGen, the study reveals significant progress in trustworthiness while identifying persistent challenges. Finally, the work provides an in-depth discussion of the challenges and future directions for trustworthy GenFMs, which reveals the complex, evolving nature of trustworthiness, highlighting the nuanced trade-offs between utility and trustworthiness, and consideration for various downstream applications, identifying persistent challenges and providing a strategic roadmap for future research. This work establishes a holistic framework for advancing trustworthiness in GenAI, paving the way for safer and more responsible integration of GenFMs into critical applications. To facilitate advancement in the community, the authors release the toolkit https://github.com/TrustGen/TrustEval-toolkit for dynamic evaluation. <br> <br>

Helix allows robots to perform tasks in home environments and demonstrates strong object generalization. Figure aims to prioritize home applications, focusing on robots generating intelligent behaviors on demand.*** <br> <br>
   Feb 20, according to [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/20/figures-humanoid-robot-takes-voice-orders-to-help-around-the-house/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAD4ZxGJhXNBBQiEsj6v5RmJc_SpTblRm0freSLTUhnfI_ugXGCdecOoX-bBbdupYo3alpCFE6nkqV9Aswoa8qkOK4ciY7mSAREdTYwzHwrXuRciDvtTLl_FB9umjSgizHFfGvzlcGClkci4Eeo1ASIgfiZ5zK_cRRNwdycyG5euG), “Figure’s humanoid robot takes voice orders to help around the house”. Figure's founder and CEO, Brett Adcock, recently introduced Helix, a new Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for humanoid robots. This announcement follows the company's decision to end its collaboration with OpenAI. Helix is designed to integrate visual data and language prompts to control robots in real time, enabling them to perform tasks based on natural language commands. This model demonstrates strong object generalization, allowing robots to handle various household items they haven't encountered before. Helix can control two robots simultaneously, facilitating collaborative tasks. Figure is showcasing Helix with its 02 humanoid robot in home environments, which are more challenging than structured settings like warehouses. The high cost and complexity of training robots for home use have been significant barriers, but Figure aims to prioritize home applications. The company highlights the need for robots to generate intelligent behaviors on demand, as manual programming is impractical for the diverse and unpredictable nature of household tasks. While Helix is still in its early stages, the announcement serves as a call for more engineers to join the project and advance its development. <br> <br>

9. ***AI Research Agent Framework:  <br>Uni of Notre Dame et al. introduces Meta MLGym and MLGym-Bench, a framework and benchmark for developing LLM agents on AI research tasks. It includes 13 diverse tasks from various domains, requiring skills like hypothesis generation and experimental analysis. The study evaluates several frontier LLMs and finds they can improve on baselines but struggle to generate novel solutions. The framework and benchmark are open-sourced.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 20, UCSB, UCL, Uni of Wisconsin-Madison, Uni of Oxford, and Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14499) “MLGym: A New Framework and Benchmark for Advancing AI Research Agents”. The work introduces Meta MLGym and MLGym-Bench, a new framework and benchmark for evaluating and developing LLM agents on AI research tasks. This is the first Gym environment for machine learning (ML) tasks, enabling research on reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for training such agents. MLGym-bench consists of 13 diverse and open-ended AI research tasks from diverse domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and game theory. Solving these tasks requires real-world AI research skills such as generating new ideas and hypotheses, creating and processing data, implementing ML methods, training models, running experiments, analyzing the results, and iterating through this process to improve on a given task. The study evaluates a number of frontier large language models (LLMs) on the benchmarks such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Llama-3.1 405B, GPT-4o, o1-preview, and Gemini-1.5 Pro. The MLGym framework makes it easy to add new tasks, integrate and evaluate models or agents, generate synthetic data at scale, as well as develop new learning algorithms for training agents on AI research tasks. The study finds that current frontier models can improve on the given baselines, usually by finding better hyperparameters, but do not generate novel hypotheses, algorithms, architectures, or substantial improvements. The authors open-source the [framework](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MLGym) and benchmark to facilitate future research in advancing the AI research capabilities of LLM agents. <br> <br>

11. ***Code Generation Test-Time Scaling:  <br>UC Berkeley's S\* paper presents a test-time scaling framework for code generation to improve coverage and selection accuracy. S\* combines parallel and sequential scaling with a novel selection mechanism based on distinguishing inputs and execution-grounded information. Experiments show S* enhances performance across models, even enabling smaller models to outperform larger ones.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 20, UC Berkeley published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14382) “S*: Test Time Scaling for Code Generation”. Increasing test-time compute for LLMs shows promise across domains but remains underexplored in code generation, despite extensive study in math. This work proposes S*, the first hybrid test-time scaling framework that substantially improves the coverage and selection accuracy of generated code. S* extends the existing parallel scaling paradigm with sequential scaling to push performance boundaries. It further leverages a novel selection mechanism that adaptively generates distinguishing inputs for pairwise comparison, combined with execution-grounded information to robustly identify correct solutions. The study evaluates across 12 Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Model and show: (1) S* consistently improves performance across model families and sizes, enabling a 3B model to outperform GPT-4o-mini; (2) S* enables non-reasoning models to surpass reasoning models - GPT-4o-mini with S* outperforms o1-preview by 3.7% on LiveCodeBench; (3) S* further boosts state-of-the-art reasoning models - DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B with S* achieves 85.7% on LiveCodeBench, approaching o1 (high) at 88.5%.

13. ***Unstructured Evidence Attribution:  <br>The Uni of Copenhagen and Uni of Michigan paper focuses on query-focused summarization with unstructured evidence citation in LLMs. The study finds that existing systems struggle with citing evidence, and that evidence tends to be "lost-in-the-middle". The work introduces the SUnsET dataset for supervision, demonstrating that LLMs adapted with SUnsET data generate more relevant evidence and summaries.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 20, Uni of Copenhagen and Uni of Michigan published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14409) “Unstructured Evidence Attribution for Long Context Query Focused Summarization”. Large language models (LLMs) are capable of generating coherent summaries from very long contexts given a user query. Extracting and properly citing evidence spans could help improve the transparency and reliability of these summaries. At the same time, LLMs suffer from positional biases in terms of which information they understand and attend to, which could affect evidence citation. Whereas previous work has focused on evidence citation with predefined levels of granularity (e.g. sentence, paragraph, document, etc.), the study proposes the task of long-context query focused summarization with unstructured evidence citation. The work shows how existing systems struggle to generate and properly cite unstructured evidence from their context, and that evidence tends to be "lost-in-the-middle". To help mitigate this, the study creates the Summaries with Unstructured Evidence Text dataset (SUnsET), a synthetic dataset generated using a novel domain-agnostic pipeline which can be used as supervision to adapt LLMs to this task. The work demonstrates across 5 LLMs of different sizes and 4 datasets with varying document types and lengths that LLMs adapted with SUnsET data generate more relevant and factually consistent evidence than their base models, extract evidence from more diverse locations in their context, and can generate more relevant and consistent summaries.

15. ***Long-Context Synthetic Data Generation:  <br>The Uni of Maryland and Uni of Mass Amherst paper introduces CLIPPER, a compression-based approach for generating high-quality synthetic data for long-context reasoning tasks. CLIPPER compresses the book into outlines and summaries, and then uses these intermediate representations to generate complex claims. CLIPPER generates more valid claims and achieves breakthrough results on narrative claim verification.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 20, Uni of Maryland and Uni of Mass Amherst published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14854) “CLIPPER: Compression enables long-context synthetic data generation”. LLM developers are increasingly reliant on synthetic data, but generating high-quality data for complex long-context reasoning tasks remains challenging. The work introduce CLIPPER, a compression-based approach for generating synthetic data tailored to narrative claim verification - a task that requires reasoning over a book to verify a given claim. Instead of generating claims directly from the raw text of the book, which results in artifact-riddled claims, CLIPPER first compresses the book into chapter outlines and book summaries and then uses these intermediate representations to generate complex claims and corresponding chain-of-thoughts. Compared to naive approaches, CLIPPER produces claims that are more valid, grounded, and complex. Using CLIPPER, the work constructs a dataset of 19K synthetic book claims paired with their source texts and chain-of-thought reasoning, and use it to fine-tune three open-weight models. The best model achieves breakthrough results on narrative claim verification (from 28% to 76% accuracy on our test set) and sets a new state-of-the-art for sub-10B models on the NoCha leaderboard. Further analysis shows that the models generate more detailed and grounded chain-of-thought reasoning while also improving performance on other narrative understanding tasks (e.g., NarrativeQA). <br> <br>

17. ***Financial Trading with RL and LLMs:  <br>Harvard Uni et al. proposes FLAG-Trader, a unified architecture combining LLMs with gradient-driven reinforcement learning (RL) for financial trading. This allows LLMs to adapt to the financial domain through parameter-efficient fine-tuning and enhances LLM performance in trading and other financial tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 19, Harvard Uni et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11433) “FLAG-Trader: Fusion LLM-Agent with Gradient-based Reinforcement Learning for Financial Trading”. Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on multimodal financial data have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities in various financial tasks. However, they often struggle with multi-step, goal-oriented scenarios in interactive financial markets, such as trading, where complex agentic approaches are required to improve decision-making. To address this, the study proposes FLAG-Trader, a unified architecture integrating linguistic processing (via LLMs) with gradient-driven reinforcement learning (RL) policy optimization, in which a partially fine-tuned LLM acts as the policy network, leveraging pre-trained knowledge while adapting to the financial domain through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Through policy gradient optimization driven by trading rewards, the framework not only enhances LLM performance in trading but also improves results on other financial-domain tasks. The study presents extensive empirical evidence to validate these enhancements. <br> <br>

21. ***Improving LLM Attention:  <br>Microsoft's MuDAF paper presents a method for improving long-context question answering performance by optimizing attention distribution at the head level through contrastive learning. MuDAF reduces attention distractions and focuses attention heads on relevant information in multi-document question answering.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 19, Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13963) “MuDAF: Long-Context Multi-Document Attention Focusing through Contrastive Learning on Attention Heads”. Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently show distracted attention due to irrelevant information in the input, which severely impairs their long-context capabilities. Inspired by recent studies on the effectiveness of retrieval heads in long-context factutality, the work aims at addressing this distraction issue through improving such retrieval heads directly. The study proposes Multi-Document Attention Focusing (MuDAF), a novel method that explicitly optimizes the attention distribution at the head level through contrastive learning. According to the experimental results, MuDAF can significantly improve the long-context question answering performance of LLMs, especially in multi-document question answering. Extensive evaluations on retrieval scores and attention visualizations show that MuDAF possesses great potential in making attention heads more focused on relevant information and reducing attention distractions. <br> <br>

23. ***Efficient Web Crawling for LLM Pretraining:  <br>Tsinghua Uni and CMU introduce Crawl4LLM, a web crawling method that prioritizes webpages based on their influence in LLM pretraining, instead of graph connectivity. Experiments show Crawl4LLM efficiently obtains high-quality pretraining data, reducing crawling waste and burden on websites.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 19, Tsinghua Uni and CMU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13347) “Craw4LLM: Efficient Web Crawling for LLM Pretraining”. Web crawl is a main source of large language models' (LLMs) pretraining data, but the majority of crawled web pages are discarded in pretraining due to low data quality. This paper presents Crawl4LLM, an efficient web crawling method that explores the web graph based on the preference of LLM pretraining. Specifically, it leverages the influence of a webpage in LLM pretraining as the priority score of the web crawler's scheduler, replacing the standard graph connectivity based priority. Experiments on a web graph containing 900 million webpages from a commercial search engine's index demonstrate the efficiency of Crawl4LLM in obtaining high-quality pretraining data. With just 21% URLs crawled, LLMs pretrained on Crawl4LLM data reach the same downstream performances of previous crawls, significantly reducing the crawling waste and alleviating the burdens on websites.

The problem led to disciplinary actions against lawyers in several cases and legal experts emphasize the need for lawyers to understand AI's limitations and verify all information.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 19, Reuters published an [article](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-hallucinations-court-papers-spell-trouble-lawyers-2025-02-18/) “AI 'hallucinations' in court papers spell trouble for lawyers”. The article discusses the growing issue of AI-generated "hallucinations" in legal filings, where AI tools create fictitious case law. This problem has led to disciplinary actions against lawyers in several cases. A notable instance involved the law firm Morgan & Morgan, where two lawyers faced potential sanctions for using fake citations in a lawsuit against Walmart. The firm warned its lawyers about the risks of relying on AI without verification. Generative AI, while useful for reducing research time, can produce false information, posing a significant risk in legal contexts. Legal experts emphasize the need for lawyers to understand AI's limitations and verify all information. Despite advancements in AI, the responsibility to ensure accuracy in legal documents remains unchanged. Instances of AI misuse highlight a broader issue of "AI literacy" among legal professionals. <br> <br>

27. ***AI CUDA Kernel Optimization:  <br>Sakana.ai presents The AI CUDA Engineer, an agentic framework for automatic CUDA kernel discovery and optimization. The framework translates torch code to CUDA kernels and iteratively improves their runtime and produces CUDA kernels that exceed the performance of torch native and compiled kernels.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 19, Sakana.ai published a [paper](https://pub.sakana.ai/static/paper.pdf) “The AI CUDA Engineer: Agentic CUDA Kernel Discovery, Optimization and Composition”. Recent advances in Large Language Models have driven large-scale deployment, resulting in ever-growing inference time and energy demand. While manual optimization of low-level code implementations is feasible, it is an arduous task that requires deep expertise to balance the complex interplay of algorithmic, software, and hardware bottlenecks. This report presents the first comprehensive agentic framework for fully automatic CUDA kernel discovery and optimization, enabling frontier large language models to perform the translation of torch code to CUDA kernels and then iteratively improve their runtime. The work introduces The AI CUDA Engineer, which acts in sequential stages. First, it translates raw PyTorch code into equivalent CUDA kernels. Next, it optimizes their runtime performance using a novel evolutionary meta-generation procedure tailored towards the CUDA ecosystem. Finally, it uses an innovation archive of discovered ’stepping stone’ kernels to improve future performance on new tasks. The AI CUDA Engineer can produce CUDA kernels that exceed the performance of torch native and compiled kernels. Out of the 250 tasks tested, The AI CUDA Engineer successfully optimizes 186 tasks to a median speedup of 1.52x. For operations such as Instance Normalization or Lower Triangular Matrix Multiplication, the work shows runtime improvements ≥145x over their torch implementations. Alongside this report, the authors release the best discovered kernels, an accompanying [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SakanaAI/AI-CUDA-Engineer-Archive) of all discovered kernels and an [interactive webpage](https://pub.sakana.ai/ai-cuda-engineer) for exploration of the results. <br> <br>

The work also proposes reward guidance to align model outputs and shows that TESS 2 improves with increased inference-time compute.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 19, Yale Uni, Uni of Washington, Allen Inst for AI and Ohio State Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13917) “TESS 2: A Large-Scale Generalist Diffusion Language Model”. The study introduces TESS 2, a general instruction-following diffusion language model that outperforms contemporary instruction-tuned diffusion models, as well as matches and sometimes exceeds strong autoregressive (AR) models. The study trains TESS 2 by first adapting a strong AR model via continued pretraining with the usual cross-entropy as diffusion loss, and then performing further instruction tuning. The work finds that adaptation training as well as the choice of the base model is crucial for training good instruction-following diffusion models. The work further proposes reward guidance, a novel and modular inference-time guidance procedure to align model outputs without needing to train the underlying model. Finally, the study shows that TESS 2 further improves with increased inference-time compute, highlighting the utility of diffusion LMs in having fine-grained controllability over the amount of compute used at inference time.

The topoconductor creates a new state of matter, producing stable qubits that can be digitally controlled. Microsoft’s approach, validated by a new [paper in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08445-2), involves a materials stack made of indium arsenide and aluminum, designed atom by atom. This architecture simplifies quantum computing by enabling digital control of qubits, making it scalable. Microsoft’s work has led to its inclusion in DARPA’s program to develop utility-scale quantum computers. The Majorana 1 chip, with its topological qubits, offers a path to a million qubits, essential for solving complex problems in chemistry, materials science, and other fields. This breakthrough could lead to innovations like self-healing materials and efficient catalysts for breaking down pollutants. The chip’s design allows it to be easily integrated into Azure datacenters, marking a significant step towards practical quantum computing. <br> <br>

The study experimentally proves that models trained on the selected data can outperform other methods in terms of model capabilities, reduce training cost, and potentially gain more control over model behaviors.***
    Feb 19, Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14050) “Diversity-driven Data Selection for Language Model Tuning through Sparse Autoencoder”. Current pre-trained large language models typically need instruction tuning to align with human preferences. However, instruction tuning data is often quantity-saturated due to the large volume of data collection and fast model iteration, leaving coreset data selection important but underexplored. On the other hand, existing quality-driven data selection methods such as LIMA (Zhou et al., 2024) and AlpaGasus (Chen et al. 2024) generally ignore the equal importance of data diversity and complexity. This work aims to design a diversity-aware data selection strategy and creatively propose using sparse autoencoders to tackle the challenge of data diversity measure. In addition, sparse autoencoders can also provide more interpretability of model behavior and explain, e.g., the surprising effectiveness of selecting the longest response (Zhao et al. 2024). Using effective data selection, the study experimentally proves that models trained on the selected data can outperform other methods in terms of model capabilities, reduce training cost, and potentially gain more control over model behaviors. <br> <br>

35. ***Accelerating LLM Inference with KV Cache Compression:  <br>Nvidia, Santa Clara AND Georgia Inst of Tech proposes RocketKV, a training-free KV cache compression strategy designed specifically to reduce both memory bandwidth and capacity demand of KV cache during the decode phase. Combining SnapKV++ and hybrid attention, RocketKV significantly reduces memory bandwidth and storage usage while maintaining accuracy.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 19, Nvidia, Santa Clara AND Georgia Inst of Tech published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14051) “RocketKV: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Two-Stage KV Cache Compression”. Transformer-based Large Language Models rely critically on KV cache to efficiently handle extended contexts during the decode phase. Yet, the size of the KV cache grows proportionally with the input length, burdening both memory bandwidth and capacity as decoding progresses. To address this challenge, the study presents RocketKV, a training-free KV cache compression strategy designed specifically to reduce both memory bandwidth and capacity demand of KV cache during the decode phase. RocketKV contains two consecutive stages. In the first stage, it performs coarse-grain KV cache eviction on the input sequence tokens with SnapKV++, a method improved upon SnapKV by introducing adaptive pooling size and full compatibility with grouped-query attention. In the second stage, it adopts a hybrid attention method to conduct fine-grain top-k sparse attention, approximating the attention scores by leveraging both head and sequence dimensional reductions. Combining these two stages, RocketKV achieves significant KV cache fetching bandwidth and storage savings while maintaining comparable accuracy to full KV cache attention. The study shows that RocketKV provides end-to-end speedup by up to 3× as well as peak memory reduction by up to 31% in the decode phase on an NVIDIA H100 GPU compared to the full KV cache baseline, while achieving negligible accuracy loss on a variety of long-context tasks. <br> <br>

37. ***Noise Conditioning in Denoising Generative Models: MIT investigates denoising-based generative models without noise conditioning and finds that most models degrade gracefully, and some even perform better. The study introduces a noise-unconditional model that achieves competitive results, challenging the belief that noise conditioning is indispensable.***
    Feb 18, MIT published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13129) “Is Noise Conditioning Necessary for Denoising Generative Models?”. It is widely believed that noise conditioning is indispensable for denoising diffusion models to work successfully. This work challenges this belief. Motivated by research on blind image denoising, the study investigates a variety of denoising-based generative models in the absence of noise conditioning. To the surprise, most models exhibit graceful degradation, and in some cases, they even perform better without noise conditioning. The work provides a theoretical analysis of the error caused by removing noise conditioning and demonstrate that the analysis aligns with empirical observations. The work further introduces a noise-unconditional model that achieves a competitive FID of 2.23 on CIFAR-10, significantly narrowing the gap to leading noise-conditional models. Hope the findings will inspire the community to revisit the foundations and formulations of denoising generative models.

39. ***Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks via Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning:  <br>MIT presents an agentic, autonomous graph expansion framework for structuring knowledge. The framework uses a reasoning-native large language model with a continually updated graph representation and organizes information into a scale-free network and yield cross-domain ideas that transcend rote summarization.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 18, MIT published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13025) “Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks”. The study presents an agentic, autonomous graph expansion framework that iteratively structures and refines knowledge in situ. Unlike conventional knowledge graph construction methods relying on static extraction or single-pass learning, the proposed approach couples a reasoning-native large language model with a continually updated graph representation. At each step, the system actively generates new concepts and relationships, merges them into a global graph, and formulates subsequent prompts based on its evolving structure. Through this feedback-driven loop, the model organizes information into a scale-free network characterized by hub formation, stable modularity, and bridging nodes that link disparate knowledge clusters. Over hundreds of iterations, new nodes and edges continue to appear without saturating, while centrality measures and shortest path distributions evolve to yield increasingly distributed connectivity. The analysis reveals emergent patterns, such as the rise of highly connected 'hub' concepts and the shifting influence of 'bridge' nodes, indicating that agentic, self-reinforcing graph construction can yield open-ended, coherent knowledge structures. Applied to materials design problems, the work presents compositional reasoning experiments by extracting node-specific and synergy-level principles to foster genuinely novel knowledge synthesis, yielding cross-domain ideas that transcend rote summarization and strengthen the framework's potential for open-ended scientific discovery. The work discusses other applications in scientific discovery and outline future directions for enhancing scalability and interpretability. <br> <br>

41. ***Reasoning Alignment on a Spectrum:  <br>Uni of Southern California aligns LLMs to System 1 (intuitive) and System 2 (analytical) thinking to allow for more flexible LLMs. The results reveal an accuracy-efficiency trade-off and show that LLMs adapt reasoning strategies based on task demands.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 18, Uni of Southern California published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12470v1) “Reasoning on a Spectrum: Aligning LLMs to System 1 and System 2 Thinking”. Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning abilities, yet their reliance on structured step-by-step processing reveals a critical limitation. While human cognition fluidly adapts between intuitive, heuristic (System 1) and analytical, deliberative (System 2) reasoning depending on the context, LLMs lack this dynamic flexibility. This rigidity can lead to brittle and unreliable performance when faced with tasks that deviate from their trained patterns. To address this, the work creates a dataset of 2,000 samples with valid System 1 and System 2 answers, explicitly align LLMs with these reasoning styles, and evaluate their performance across reasoning benchmarks. The results reveal an accuracy-efficiency trade-off: System 2-aligned models excel in arithmetic and symbolic reasoning, while System 1-aligned models perform better in commonsense tasks. A mechanistic analysis of model responses shows that System 1 models employ more definitive answers, whereas System 2 models demonstrate greater uncertainty. Interpolating between these extremes produces a monotonic transition in reasoning accuracy, preserving coherence. This work challenges the assumption that step-by-step reasoning is always optimal and highlights the need for adapting reasoning strategies based on task demands. <br> <br>

43. ***Automated LLM Agent Framework:  <br>Uni of Hong Kong introduces AutoAgent, a fully-automated and zero-code framework that enables users to create and deploy LLM agents through natural language alone. AutoAgent demonstrates effectiveness in generalist multi-agent tasks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 18, Uni of Hong Kong published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05957) “AutoAgent: A Fully-Automated and Zero-Code Framework for LLM Agents”. Large Language Model (LLM) Agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in task automation and intelligent decision-making, driving the widespread adoption of agent development frameworks such as LangChain and AutoGen. However, these frameworks predominantly serve developers with extensive technical expertise - a significant limitation considering that only 0.03 % of the global population possesses the necessary programming skills. This stark accessibility gap raises a fundamental question: Can we enable everyone, regardless of technical background, to build their own LLM agents using natural language alone? To address this challenge, the authors introduce AutoAgent-a Fully-Automated and highly Self-Developing framework that enables users to create and deploy LLM agents through Natural Language Alone. Operating as an autonomous Agent Operating System, AutoAgent comprises four key components: i) Agentic System Utilities, ii) LLM-powered Actionable Engine, iii) Self-Managing File System, and iv) Self-Play Agent Customization module. This lightweight yet powerful system enables efficient and dynamic creation and modification of tools, agents, and workflows without coding requirements or manual intervention. Beyond its code-free agent development capabilities, AutoAgent also serves as a versatile multi-agent system for General AI Assistants. Comprehensive evaluations on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate AutoAgent's effectiveness in generalist multi-agent tasks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, AutoAgent's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-related capabilities have shown consistently superior performance compared to many alternative LLM-based solutions.

The study evaluates model performance and find that frontier models are still unable to solve the majority of tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 17, OpenAI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12115) “SWE-Lancer: Can Frontier LLMs Earn $1 Million from Real-World Freelance Software Engineering?”. The work introduces SWE-Lancer, a benchmark of over 1,400 freelance software engineering tasks from Upwork, valued at 1 million USD total in real-world payouts. SWE-Lancer encompasses both independent engineering tasks--ranging from 50 bug fixes to $32,000 feature implementations--and managerial tasks, where models choose between technical implementation proposals. Independent tasks are graded with end-to-end tests triple-verified by experienced software engineers, while managerial decisions are assessed against the choices of the original hired engineering managers. The study evaluates model performance and find that frontier models are still unable to solve the majority of tasks. To facilitate future research, the study open-sources a unified Docker image and a public evaluation split, SWE-Lancer Diamond (https://github.com/openai/SWELancer-Benchmark). By mapping model performance to monetary value, the authors hope SWE-Lancer enables greater research into the economic impact of AI model development. <br> <br>

47. ***Small Model Reasoning Limitations:  <br>Uni of Washington, CMU and Western Washington Uni uncovers that small models don't consistently benefit from long CoT reasoning or distillation from larger models. The study proposes Mix Distillation, to balance reasoning complexity and improve small model reasoning performance.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 17, Uni of Washington, CMU and Western Washington Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12143) “Small Models Struggle to Learn from Strong Reasoners”. Large language models (LLMs) excel in complex reasoning tasks, and distilling their reasoning capabilities into smaller models has shown promise. However, the study uncovers an interesting phenomenon, which is termed as the Small Model Learnability Gap: small models (≤3B parameters) do not consistently benefit from long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning or distillation from larger models. Instead, they perform better when fine-tuned on shorter, simpler reasoning chains that better align with their intrinsic learning capacity. To address this, the study proposes Mix Distillation, a simple yet effective strategy that balances reasoning complexity by combining long and short CoT examples or reasoning from both larger and smaller models. Experiments demonstrate that Mix Distillation significantly improves small model reasoning performance compared to training on either data alone. These findings highlight the limitations of direct strong model distillation and underscore the importance of adapting reasoning complexity for effective reasoning capability transfer. <br> <br>

49. ***Efficient RL Data Selection for Language Model Scaling:  <br>SJTU, SII and GAIR introduces Learning Impact Measurement (LIM), an automated method to evaluate and prioritize training samples. LIM achieves comparable or even superior performance using only 1,389 samples versus the full 8,523 samples dataset.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 17, SJTU, SII and GAIR published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11886) “LIMR: Less is More for RL Scaling”. The study asks: what truly determines the effectiveness of RL training data for enhancing language models’ reasoning capabilities? While recent advances like o1, Deepseek R1, and Kimi1.5 demonstrate RL’s potential, the lack of transparency about training data requirements has hindered systematic progress. Starting directly from base models without distillation, the work challenges the assumption that scaling up RL training data inherently improves performance. The study demonstrates that a strategically selected subset of just 1,389 samples can outperform the full 8,523-sample dataset. The work introduces Learning Impact Measurement (LIM), an automated method to evaluate and prioritize training samples based on their alignment with model learning trajectories, enabling efficient resource utilization and scalable implementation. The method achieves comparable or even superior performance using only 1,389 samples versus the full 8,523 samples dataset. Notably, while recent data-efficient approaches (e.g., LIMO and s1) show promise with 32B-scale models, the study finds it significantly underperforms at 7B-scale through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In contrast, the RL-based LIMR achieves 16.7% higher accuracy on AIME24 and outperforms LIMO and s1 by 13.0% and 22.2% on MATH500. These results fundamentally reshape the understanding of RL scaling in LLMs, demonstrating that precise sample selection, rather than data scale, may be the key to unlocking enhanced reasoning capabilities. For reproducible research and future innovation, the authors are open-sourcing LIMR, including implementation of LIM, training and evaluation code, curated datasets, and trained models at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/LIMR. <br> <br>

51. ***Adaptive Long-Context Head Identification:  <br>Meta and ETH Zurich observe that some attention heads consistently attend to local information, while others switch between local and long-context based on the query. The work shows that it’s possible to predict crucial long-context heads using only local keys and aims for significant gains in efficiency.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 17, Meta and ETH Zurich published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09647) “Unveiling Simplicities of Attention: Adaptive Long-Context Head Identification”. The ability to process long contexts is crucial for many natural language processing tasks, yet it remains a significant challenge. While substantial progress has been made in enhancing the efficiency of attention mechanisms, there is still a gap in understanding how attention heads function in long-context settings. This work observes that while certain heads consistently attend to local information only, others swing between attending to local and long-context information depending on the query. This raises the question: can we identify which heads require long-context information to predict the next token accurately? The study demonstrates that it’s possible to predict which heads are crucial for long-context processing using only local keys. The core idea here is to exploit a simple model for the long-context scores via second moment approximations. These findings unveil simple properties of attention in the context of long sequences, and open the door to potentially significant gains in efficiency. <br> <br>

53. ***Evaluating Multi-Agent Debate:  <br>Penn State Uni et al. present a systematic evaluation of multi-agent debate (MAD) methods and find they don't reliably outperform simple single-agent baselines. Model heterogeneity can significantly improve MAD frameworks, which enables a single LLM agent to access the output from heterogeneous foundation models, improving current MAD frameworks.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 17, Penn State Uni, Northwestern PloyTech Uni, Singapore Management Uni and SAIL published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08788) “If Multi-Agent Debate is the Answer, What is the Question?”. Multi-agent debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the factual accuracy and reasoning quality of large language models (LLMs) by engaging multiple agents in iterative discussions during inference. Despite its potential, the work argues that current MAD research suffers from critical shortcomings in evaluation practices, including limited dataset overlap and inconsistent baselines, raising significant concerns about generalizability. Correspondingly, this paper presents a systematic evaluation of five representative MAD methods across nine benchmarks using four foundational models. Surprisingly, the findings reveal that MAD methods fail to reliably outperform simple single-agent baselines such as Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency, even when consuming additional inference-time computation. From the analysis, the study found that model heterogeneity can significantly improve MAD frameworks. The study proposes Heter-MAD enabling a single LLM agent to access the output from heterogeneous foundation models, which boosts the performance of current MAD frameworks. Finally, the study outlines potential directions for advancing MAD, aiming to spark a broader conversation and inspire future work in this area. <br> <br>

55. ***Extensible Agentic Framework for Complex Reasoning:  <br>Stanford Uni introduces OctoTools, a training-free, user-friendly, and extensible open-source agentic framework designed to tackle complex reasoning across diverse domains. OctoTools utilizes standardized tool cards, a planner, and an executor, achieving substantial average accuracy gains over GPT-4o.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 16, Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11271) “OctoTools: An Agentic Framework with Extensible Tools for Complex Reasoning”. Solving complex reasoning tasks may involve visual understanding, domain knowledge retrieval, numerical calculation, and multi-step reasoning. Existing methods augment large language models (LLMs) with external tools but are restricted to specialized domains, limited tool types, or require additional training data. This study introduces OctoTools, a training-free, user-friendly, and easily extensible open-source agentic framework designed to tackle complex reasoning across diverse domains. OctoTools introduces standardized tool cards to encapsulate tool functionality, a planner for both high-level and low-level planning, and an executor to carry out tool usage. The work validates OctoTools' generality across 16 diverse tasks (including MathVista, MMLU-Pro, MedQA, and GAIA-Text), achieving substantial average accuracy gains of 9.3% over GPT-4o. Furthermore, OctoTools outperforms AutoGen, GPT-Functions and LangChain by up to 10.6% when given the same set of tools. Through comprehensive analysis and ablations, OctoTools demonstrates advantages in task planning, effective tool usage, and multi-step problem solving. <br> <br>

57. ***Hardware-Aligned Sparse Attention:  <br>DeepSeek presents NSA, a Natively trainable Sparse Attention mechanism that integrates algorithmic innovations with hardware-aligned optimizations for efficient long-context modeling. NSA achieves substantial speedups over Full Attention across decoding, forward propagation, and backward propagation.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 16, DeepSeek published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11089) “Native Sparse Attention: Hardware-Aligned and Natively Trainable Sparse Attention”. Long-context modeling is crucial for next-generation language models, yet the high computational cost of standard attention mechanisms poses significant computational challenges. Sparse attention offers a promising direction for improving efficiency while maintaining model capabilities. The work presents NSA, a Natively trainable Sparse Attention mechanism that integrates algorithmic innovations with hardware-aligned optimizations to achieve efficient long-context modeling. NSA employs a dynamic hierarchical sparse strategy, combining coarse-grained token compression with fine-grained token selection to preserve both global context awareness and local precision. The approach advances sparse attention design with two key innovations: (1) the work achieves substantial speedups through arithmetic intensity-balanced algorithm design, with implementation optimizations for modern hardware. (2) the work enables end-to-end training, reducing pretraining computation without sacrificing model performance. As shown in Figure 1, experiments show the model pretrained with NSA maintains or exceeds Full Attention models across general benchmarks, long-context tasks, and instruction-based reasoning. Meanwhile, NSA achieves substantial speedups over Full Attention on 64k-length sequences across decoding, forward propagation, and backward propagation, validating its efficiency throughout the model lifecycle. <br> <br>

59. ***Knowledge Graph Extraction with LMs:  <br>Stanford Uni, Uni of Toronto and FAR AI introduce KGGen, a text-to-KG generator using language models that clusters related entities to reduce sparsity in extracted KGs. The work also releases the MINE benchmark to test an extractor's ability to produce a useful KG from plain text, showcasing far superior performance.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 14, Stanford Uni, Uni of Toronto and FAR AI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09956) “KGGen: Extracting Knowledge Graphs from Plain Text with Language Models”. Recent interest in building foundation models for KGs has highlighted a fundamental challenge: knowledge-graph data is relatively scarce. The best-known KGs are primarily human-labeled, created by pattern-matching, or extracted using early NLP techniques. While human-generated KGs are in short supply, automatically extracted KGs are of questionable quality. The study presents a solution to this data scarcity problem in the form of a text-to-KG generator (KGGen), a package that uses language models to create high-quality graphs from plaintext. Unlike other KG extractors, KGGen clusters related entities to reduce sparsity in extracted KGs. KGGen is available as a Python library (pip install kg-gen), making it accessible to everyone. Along with KGGen, the authors release the first benchmark, Measure of of Information in Nodes and Edges (MINE), that tests an extractor's ability to produce a useful KG from plain text. The authors benchmark the new tool against existing extractors and demonstrate far superior performance. <br> <br>

61. ***Diverse Inference and Verification for Reasoning:  <br>Boston Uni et al. uses a diverse inference approach with multiple models and methods at test time. The study finds that verifying mathematics and code problems, and rejection sampling on other problems is simple and effective, which results in improved accuracy on diverse tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 14, Boston Uni, NotBadMath.AI, Google, Columbia Uni, MIT, Intuit, and Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09955) “Diverse Inference and Verification for Advanced Reasoning”. Reasoning LLMs such as OpenAI o1, o3 and DeepSeek R1 have made significant progress in mathematics and coding, yet find challenging advanced tasks such as International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) combinatorics problems, Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) puzzles, and Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) questions. The study uses a diverse inference approach that combines multiple models and methods at test time. The study finds that verifying mathematics and code problems, and rejection sampling on other problems is simple and effective. The work automatically verifies correctness of solutions to IMO problems by Lean, and ARC puzzles by code, and find that best-of-N effectively answers HLE questions. The approach increases answer accuracy on IMO combinatorics problems from 33.3% to 77.8%, accuracy on HLE questions from 8% to 37%, and solves 80% of ARC puzzles that 948 humans could not and 26.5% of ARC puzzles that o3 high compute does not. Test-time simulations, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning with inference feedback improve generalization by adapting agent graph representations and varying prompts, code, and datasets. The approach is reliable, robust, and scalable, and in the spirit of reproducible research, the authors will make it publicly available upon publication. <br> <br>

63. ***Theoretical Framework for Imbalanced Data Learning:  <br>Google and Courant Inst of Math introduces a novel theoretical framework for analyzing generalization in imbalanced classification. The study proposes a new class-imbalanced margin loss function, proves its strong H-consistency, and derives learning guarantees with new algorithms (IMMAX).*** <br> <br>
    Feb 14, Google and Courant Inst of Math published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10381) “Balancing the Scales: A Theoretical and Algorithmic Framework for Learning from Imbalanced Data”. Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially in multi-class problems with long-tailed distributions. Existing methods, such as data resampling, cost-sensitive techniques, and logistic loss modifications, though popular and often effective, lack solid theoretical foundations. As an example, the work demonstrates that cost-sensitive methods are not Bayes consistent. This paper introduces a novel theoretical framework for analyzing generalization in imbalanced classification. The work proposes a new class-imbalanced margin loss function for both binary and multi-class settings, prove its strong H-consistency, and derive corresponding learning guarantees based on empirical loss and a new notion of class-sensitive Rademacher complexity. Leveraging these theoretical results, the study devises novel and general learning algorithms, IMMAX (Imbalanced Margin Maximization), which incorporate confidence margins and are applicable to various hypothesis sets. While the focus is theoretical, the study also presents extensive empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithms compared to existing baselines. <br> <br>

65. ***Overthinking in Agentic Tasks:  <br>UC Berkeley et al. introduces and analyzes overthinking in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) in interactive environments and observes three recurring patterns. Mitigating overthinking, such as selecting solutions with lower overthinking scores, can improve model performance and reduce computational costs.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 12, UC Berkeley, ETH, UIUC and CMU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08235) “The Danger of Overthinking: Examining the Reasoning-Action Dilemma in Agentic Tasks”. Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) represent a breakthrough in AI problem-solving capabilities, but their effectiveness in interactive environments can be limited. This paper introduces and analyzes overthinking in LRMs. A phenomenon where models favor extended internal reasoning chains over environmental interaction. Through experiments on software engineering tasks using SWE Bench Verified, the study observes three recurring patterns: Analysis Paralysis, Rogue Actions, and Premature Disengagement. The work proposes a framework to study these behaviors, which correlates with human expert assessments, and analyze 4018 trajectories. The study observes that higher overthinking scores correlate with decreased performance, with reasoning models exhibiting stronger tendencies toward overthinking compared to non-reasoning models. The analysis reveals that simple efforts to mitigate overthinking in agentic environments, such as selecting the solution with the lower overthinking score, can improve model performance by almost 30% while reducing computational costs by 43%. These results suggest that mitigating overthinking has strong practical implications. The work suggests that by leveraging native function-calling capabilities and selective reinforcement learning overthinking tendencies could be mitigated. The authors also open-source the evaluation framework and dataset to facilitate research in this direction at https://github.com/AlexCuadron/Overthinking. <br> <br>

67. ***Consumer Identification of AI-Generated Fakes:  <br>iProov's research reveals that most people struggle to identify deepfakes. The study highlights concerns about video-based fraud, reduced trust in online information, and the need for advanced biometric technology with liveness detection.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 12, according to an [iProov article](https://www.iproov.com/press/study-reveals-deepfake-blindspot-detect-ai-generated-content), Most Consumers Can’t Identify AI-Generated Fakes. New research by iProov reveals that most people struggle to identify deepfakes, with only 0.1% of 2,000 UK and US consumers accurately distinguishing real from fake content. The study highlights several key findings: deepfake detection is alarmingly low, especially among older generations who are less aware of the technology. Deepfake videos are harder to identify than images, raising concerns about video-based fraud. Despite rising awareness, many remain unaware of deepfakes, and overconfidence in detection skills is common, particularly among young adults. Social media platforms like Meta and TikTok are seen as hotspots for deepfakes, leading to reduced trust in online information. The study also shows that most people do not take action when encountering suspected deepfakes, often due to a lack of knowledge on how to report them. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that few consumers actively verify the authenticity of online information. Experts like Professor Edgar Whitley emphasize the need for organizations to adopt advanced biometric technology with liveness detection to combat deepfakes. iProov's 2024 Threat Intelligence Report noted a 704% increase in face swaps, underscoring the growing threat. To mitigate risks, collaboration between technology providers, platforms, and policymakers is essential. <br> <br>

69. ***Need for New Vocabulary to Understand AI:  <br>Google argues that we cannot understand AI using our existing vocabulary and should develop neologisms to represent precise human or machine concepts. Successful neologisms achieve a useful amount of abstraction and the authors demonstrate how neologisms enable controlling LLM response length and allow sampling more variable responses.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 11, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07586) “We Can't Understand AI Using our Existing Vocabulary”. This position paper argues that, in order to understand AI, we cannot rely on our existing vocabulary of human words. Instead, we should strive to develop neologisms: new words that represent precise human concepts that we want to teach machines, or machine concepts that we need to learn. The study starts from the premise that humans and machines have differing concepts. This means interpretability can be framed as a communication problem: humans must be able to reference and control machine concepts, and communicate human concepts to machines. Creating a shared human-machine language through developing neologisms, the study believes, could solve this communication problem. Successful neologisms achieve a useful amount of abstraction: not too detailed, so they're reusable in many contexts, and not too high-level, so they convey precise information. As a proof of concept, the work demonstrates how a "length neologism" enables controlling LLM response length, while a "diversity neologism" allows sampling more variable responses. Taken together, the authors argue that poeple cannot understand AI using existing vocabulary, and expanding it through neologisms creates opportunities for both controlling and understanding machines better. <br> <br>

They propose Anomaly-OneVision (Anomaly-OV), the first specialist visual assistant for ZSAD and reasoning which leverages a Look-Twice Feature Matching (LTFM) mechanism to adaptively select and emphasize abnormal visual tokens.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 11, Johns Hopkins Uni and Honda Research published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07601) “Towards Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection and Reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models”. Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) is an emerging AD paradigm. Unlike the traditional unsupervised AD setting that requires a large number of normal samples to train a model, ZSAD is more practical for handling data-restricted real-world scenarios. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown revolutionary reasoning capabilities in various vision tasks. However, the reasoning of image abnormalities remains underexplored due to the lack of corresponding datasets and benchmarks. To facilitate research in AD & reasoning, the study establishes the first visual instruction tuning dataset, Anomaly-Instruct-125k, and the evaluation benchmark, VisA-D&R. Through investigation with the benchmark, the study reveals that current MLLMs like GPT-4o cannot accurately detect and describe fine-grained anomalous details in images. To address this, the study proposes Anomaly-OneVision (Anomaly-OV), the first specialist visual assistant for ZSAD and reasoning. Inspired by human behavior in visual inspection, Anomaly-OV leverages a Look-Twice Feature Matching (LTFM) mechanism to adaptively select and emphasize abnormal visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomaly-OV achieves significant improvements over advanced generalist models in both detection and reasoning.

73. ***Jailbreaking to Jailbreak:  <br>ScaleAI introduces an LLM-as-red-teamer approach in which a human jailbreaks a refusal-trained LLM to make it willing to jailbreak itself or other LLMs. The experiments demonstrate that a jailbroken version of itself is able to bypass an LLM's safeguards and is an overlooked failure mode of the safeguard.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 9, ScaleAI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09638) “Jailbreaking to Jailbreak”. Refusal training on Large Language Models (LLMs) prevents harmful outputs, yet this defense remains vulnerable to both automated and human-crafted jailbreaks. The work presents a novel LLM-as-red-teamer approach in which a human jailbreaks a refusal-trained LLM to make it willing to jailbreak itself or other LLMs. The paper refers to the jailbroken LLMs as J_2 attackers, which can systematically evaluate target models using various red teaming strategies and improve its performance via in-context learning from the previous failures. Experiments demonstrate that Sonnet 3.5 and Gemini 1.5 pro outperform other LLMs as J_2, achieving 93.0% and 91.0% attack success rates (ASRs) respectively against GPT-4o (and similar results across other capable LLMs) on Harmbench. The work not only introduces a scalable approach to strategic red teaming, drawing inspiration from human red teamers, but also highlights jailbreaking-to-jailbreak as an overlooked failure mode of the safeguard. Specifically, an LLM can bypass its own safeguards by employing a jailbroken version of itself that is willing to assist in further jailbreaking. To prevent any direct misuse with J_2, while advancing research in AI safety, the paper publicly shares the methodology while keeping specific prompting details private. <br> <br>

75. ***Enabling Masked Infilling in Autoregressive Models:  <br>UCLA introduces MARIA (Masked and Autoregressive Infilling Architecture), a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both autoregressive (AR) and masked language modeling (MLM) and combines a pre-trained MLM and AR model by training a linear decoder that takes their concatenated hidden states as input. Experimental results demonstrate that MARIA significantly outperforms existing methods on masked infilling tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 9, UCLA published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06901) “Enabling Autoregressive Models to Fill In Masked Tokens”. Historically, LLMs have been trained using either autoregressive (AR) or masked language modeling (MLM) objectives, with AR models gaining dominance in recent years. However, AR models are inherently incapable of masked infilling, which is the ability to predict masked tokens between past and future context. In contrast, MLM models suffer from intrinsic computational inefficiencies during both training and inference that hinder their scalability. This work introduces MARIA (Masked and Autoregressive Infilling Architecture), a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both paradigms to achieve state-of-the-art masked infilling performance. MARIA combines a pre-trained MLM and AR model by training a linear decoder that takes their concatenated hidden states as input. This minimal modification enables the AR model to perform infilling while retaining its inherent advantages in terms of faster inference with KV caching. Experimental results demonstrate that MARIA significantly outperforms existing methods, namely discrete diffusion models, on masked infilling tasks.

1. ***Novel Citation Method.  <br>Meta and MIT introduced SelfCite, a self-supervised learning method for LLMs to generate sentence-level citations. SelfCite uses the LLM itself to create a reward signal based on context ablation, guiding the model to improve citation quality through best-of-N sampling and preference optimization, achieving a significant F1 score increase on long-form question answering tasks.*** <br> <br>
   Feb 13, Meta and MIT published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09604) “SelfCite: Self-Supervised Alignment for Context Attribution in Large Language Models”. The study introduces SelfCite, a novel self-supervised approach that aligns LLMs to generate high-quality, fine-grained, sentence-level citations for the statements in their generated responses. Instead of only relying on costly and labor-intensive annotations, SelfCite leverages a reward signal provided by the LLM itself through context ablation: If a citation is necessary, removing the cited text from the context should prevent the same response; if sufficient, retaining the cited text alone should preserve the same response. This reward can guide the inference-time best-of-N sampling strategy to improve citation quality significantly, as well as be used in preference optimization to directly fine-tune the models for generating better citations. The effectiveness of SelfCite is demonstrated by increasing citation F1 up to 5.3 points on the LongBench-Cite benchmark across five long-form question answering tasks. <br> <br>

3. ***Synthetic Data Curation Theory.  <br>Google and UCLA's paper explores the use of synthetic data in LLM training, developing a theoretical framework to determine the minimal curation needed to ensure continuous performance improvement. They propose a training procedure inspired by boosting that converges to an optimal LLM even with mostly poor-quality non-synthetic data, validating their theory with experiments showing improved performance through dynamic focus on challenging examples.*** <br> <br>
   Feb 13, Google and USCLA published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08924) “Escaping Collapse: The Strength of Weak Data for Large Language Model Training”. Synthetically-generated data plays an increasingly larger role in training large language models. However, while synthetic data has been found to be useful, studies have also shown that without proper curation it can cause LLM performance to plateau, or even "collapse", after many training iterations. This study formalizes this question and develop a theoretical framework to investigate how much curation is needed in order to ensure that LLM performance continually improves. The study finds that the requirements are nearly minimal. The study describes a training procedure that converges to an optimal LLM even if almost all of the non-synthetic training data is of poor quality. The analysis is inspired by boosting, a classic machine learning technique that leverages a very weak learning algorithm to produce an arbitrarily good classifier. The training procedure subsumes many recently proposed methods for training LLMs on synthetic data, and thus the analysis sheds light on why they are successful, and also suggests opportunities for future improvement. The paper presents experiments that validate the theory, and show that dynamically focusing labeling resources on the most challenging examples -- in much the same way that boosting focuses the efforts of the weak learner -- leads to improved performance. <br> <br>

5. ***mproved Word Embeddings.  <br>AI Sweden's paper introduces Coupled Adam, a modified optimizer designed to address the anisotropy issue in LLM word representations, which they attribute to the second moment in Adam. Experiments show Coupled Adam enhances embedding quality and improves both upstream and downstream performance on large datasets.*** <br> <br>
   Feb 13, AI Sweden published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08441) “Better Embeddings with Coupled Adam”. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs learn word representations that exhibit the undesirable yet poorly understood feature of anisotropy. The paper argues that the second moment in Adam is a cause of anisotropic embeddings, and suggest a modified optimizer called Coupled Adam to mitigate the problem. Experiments demonstrate that Coupled Adam significantly improves the quality of embeddings, while also leading to better upstream and downstream performance on large enough datasets. <br> <br>

7. ***Code-Based Reasoning Condensation.  <br>DeepSeek, Shanghai Jiao Tong Uni, and HKUST proposed CodeI/O, a method to condense diverse reasoning patterns from code into a code input-output prediction format. By training models to predict inputs/outputs from code and CoT rationales, CodeI/O exposes LLMs to universal reasoning primitives, leading to improved performance across various reasoning tasks, further enhanced by a multi-turn revision process called CodeI/O++.*** <br> <br>
   Feb 12, DeepSeek, Shanghai Jiao Tong Uni and HKUST published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07316) “CodeI/O: Condensing Reasoning Patterns via Code Input-Output Prediction”. Reasoning is a fundamental capability of Large Language Models. While prior research predominantly focuses on enhancing narrow skills like math or code generation, improving performance on many other reasoning tasks remains challenging due to sparse and fragmented training data. To address this issue, the study proposes CodeI/O, a novel approach that systematically condenses diverse reasoning patterns inherently embedded in contextually-grounded codes, through transforming the original code into a code input-output prediction format. By training models to predict inputs/outputs given code and test cases entirely in natural language as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales, the study exposes them to universal reasoning primitives -- like logic flow planning, state-space searching, decision tree traversal, and modular decomposition -- while decoupling structured reasoning from code-specific syntax and preserving procedural rigor. Experimental results demonstrate CodeI/O leads to consistent improvements across symbolic, scientific, logic, math & numerical, and commonsense reasoning tasks. By matching the existing ground-truth outputs or re-executing the code with predicted inputs, the work can verify each prediction and further enhance the CoTs through multi-turn revision, resulting in CodeI/O++ and achieving higher performance. The data and models are available at https://github.com/hkust-nlp/CodeIO. <br> <br>

9. ***Distillation Scaling Laws Defined.  <br>Apple and Uni of Oxford presented distillation scaling laws to optimize compute allocation between teacher and student models in knowledge distillation. Their findings provide recipes for compute-optimal distillation, showing distillation's advantage over supervised pretraining under certain conditions and offering insights to improve distillation strategies.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 12, Apple and Uni of Oxford published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08606) “Distillation Scaling Laws”. The paper provides a distillation scaling law that estimates distilled model performance based on a compute budget and its allocation between the student and teacher. The findings reduce the risks associated with using distillation at scale; compute allocation for both the teacher and student models can now be done to maximize student performance. The paper provides compute optimal distillation recipes for when 1) a teacher exists, or 2) a teacher needs training. If many students are to be distilled, or a teacher already exists, distillation outperforms supervised pretraining until a compute level which grows predictably with student size. If one student is to be distilled and a teacher also needs training, supervised learning should be done instead. Additionally, the paper provides insights across the large scale study of distillation, which increase the understanding of distillation and inform experimental design. <br> <br>

11. ***Continuous Concept Pretraining.  <br>Meta, KAIST, and UC San Diego introduced Continuous Concept Mixing (CoCoMix), a novel pretraining framework that combines next token prediction with predicting continuous concepts from a sparse autoencoder. CoCoMix improves sample efficiency and outperforms standard pretraining methods, enhancing model interpretability and steerability through concept manipulation.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 12, Meta, KAIST, and UC San Diego published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08524) “LLM Pretraining with Continuous Concepts”. Next token prediction has been the standard training objective used in large language model pretraining. Representations are learned as a result of optimizing for token-level perplexity. The study proposes Continuous Concept Mixing (CoCoMix), a novel pretraining framework that combines discrete next token prediction with continuous concepts. Specifically, CoCoMix predicts continuous concepts learned from a pretrained sparse autoencoder and mixes them into the model's hidden state by interleaving with token hidden representations. Through experiments on multiple benchmarks, including language modeling and downstream reasoning tasks, the study shows that CoCoMix is more sample efficient and consistently outperforms standard next token prediction, knowledge distillation and inserting pause tokens. The study finds that combining both concept learning and interleaving in an end-to-end framework is critical to performance gains. Furthermore, CoCoMix enhances interpretability and steerability by allowing direct inspection and modification of the predicted concept, offering a transparent way to guide the model's internal reasoning process. <br> <br>

13. ***Efficient Optimizer Design via Fisher Approximation.  <br>Microsoft's paper proposes a systematic approach to design efficient LLM optimizers based on structured Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) approximation. They derive two new memory-efficient optimizers, RACS and Alice, validated on LLaMA pre-training, demonstrating faster and better convergence with reduced memory overhead compared to baselines.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 11, Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07752) “Towards Efficient Optimizer Design for LLM via Structured Fisher Approximation with a Low-Rank Extension”. Designing efficient optimizers for large language models (LLMs) with low-memory requirements and fast convergence is an important and challenging problem. This paper makes a step towards the systematic design of such optimizers through the lens of structured Fisher information matrix (FIM) approximation. The work shows that many state-of-the-art efficient optimizers can be viewed as solutions to FIM approximation (under the Frobenius norm) with specific structural assumptions. Building on these insights, the study proposes two design recommendations of practical efficient optimizers for LLMs, involving the careful selection of structural assumptions to balance generality and efficiency, and enhancing memory efficiency of optimizers with general structures through a novel low-rank extension framework. The work demonstrates how to use each design approach by deriving new memory-efficient optimizers: Row and Column Scaled SGD (RACS) and Adaptive low-dimensional subspace estimation (Alice). Experiments on LLaMA pre-training (up to 1B parameters) validate the effectiveness, showing faster and better convergence than existing memory-efficient baselines and Adam with little memory overhead. Notably, Alice achieves better than 2x faster convergence over Adam, while RACS delivers strong performance on the 1B model with SGD-like memory. <br> <br>

15. ***AI Chatbot News Summary Inaccuracies.  <br>BBC research reveals that major AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and Perplexity AI, produce news summaries with significant inaccuracies, with 51% having notable issues and 19% containing factual errors, raising concerns about real-world harm and prompting calls for tech companies to improve accuracy and transparency.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 11, according to [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m17d8827ko), AI chatbots unable to accurately summarise news. The BBC conducted [research](https://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/documents/bbc-research-into-ai-assistants.pdf) on four major AI chatbots—OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, Google's Gemini, and Perplexity AI—revealing significant inaccuracies in their news summaries. The study involved asking these chatbots to summarize 100 BBC news stories, with experts rating the quality of their responses. Results showed that 51% of the AI-generated answers had notable issues, and 19% contained factual errors. Deborah Turness, CEO of BBC News, [expressed concerns](https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/2025/articles/how-distortion-is-affecting-ai-assistants/) about the potential real-world harm from AI-distorted headlines and called for a collaborative approach with AI developers to address these issues. Examples of inaccuracies included Gemini's incorrect statement about NHS vaping recommendations and ChatGPT and Copilot's outdated information on political figures. The BBC urged tech companies to "pull back" their AI news summaries, similar to Apple's response to previous complaints. The report highlighted the need for publishers to control how their content is used and for AI companies to improve transparency and accuracy in their news processing. <br> <br>

17. ***Nature Language Model for Science.  <br>Microsoft introduced NatureLM, a sequence-based foundation model pre-trained on multi-scientific domain data, designed for scientific discovery. NatureLM enables cross-domain applications like generating and optimizing molecules, proteins, and RNA with text instructions, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in scientific tasks, offering a versatile approach for drug and material design.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 11, Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07527) “NatureLM: Deciphering the Language of Nature for Scientific Discovery”. Foundation models have revolutionized natural language processing and artificial intelligence, significantly enhancing how machines comprehend and generate human languages. Inspired by the success of these foundation models, researchers have developed foundation models for individual scientific domains, including small molecules, materials, proteins, DNA, and RNA. However, these models are typically trained in isolation, lacking the ability to integrate across different scientific domains. Recognizing that entities within these domains can all be represented as sequences, which together form the "language of nature", the study introduces Nature Language Model (briefly, NatureLM), a sequence-based science foundation model designed for scientific discovery. Pre-trained with data from multiple scientific domains, NatureLM offers a unified, versatile model that enables various applications including: (i) generating and optimizing small molecules, proteins, RNA, and materials using text instructions; (ii) cross-domain generation/design, such as protein-to-molecule and protein-to-RNA generation; and (iii) achieving state-of-the-art performance in tasks like SMILES-to-IUPAC translation and retrosynthesis on USPTO-50k. NatureLM offers a promising generalist approach for various scientific tasks, including drug discovery (hit generation/optimization, ADMET optimization, synthesis), novel material design, and the development of therapeutic proteins or nucleotides. The authors have developed NatureLM models in different sizes (1 billion, 8 billion, and 46.7 billion parameters) and observed a clear improvement in performance as the model size increases. <br> <br>

19. ***Three Observations on AGI's Trajectory.  <br>Sam Altman's blog post outlines three observations: AI intelligence scales with the log of resources, AI usage cost decreases tenfold annually leading to wider adoption, and the value of increased intelligence is super-exponential. He anticipates AI agents revolutionizing fields and emphasizes the need for equitable AGI benefit distribution and safety.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 10, Sam Altman post a [blog](https://blog.samaltman.com/three-observations) “Three Observations”. The mission is to ensure AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) benefits all of humanity. AGI refers to systems that can solve complex problems at a human level across various fields. Human innovation has historically led to significant progress, and AGI is seen as the next major tool in this progression, potentially leading to unprecedented economic growth and societal benefits. The observations are: 
•	The intelligence of an AI model roughly equals the log of the resources used to train and run it. These resources are chiefly training compute, data, and inference compute. It appears that you can spend arbitrary amounts of money and get continuous and predictable gains; the scaling laws that predict this are accurate over many orders of magnitude. 
•	The cost to use a given level of AI falls about 10x every 12 months, and lower prices lead to much more use. 
•	The socioeconomic value of linearly increasing intelligence is super-exponential in nature. A consequence of this is that we see no reason for exponentially increasing investment to stop in the near future. 
AI agents, like virtual co-workers, are being developed and could revolutionize various fields, similar to how transistors impacted the economy. While short-term changes may be minimal, long-term societal and economic impacts will be substantial. Ensuring AGI benefits are widely distributed is crucial, and public policy will play a significant role in integrating AGI into society. Balancing safety and individual empowerment is essential to prevent misuse by authoritarian regimes. The goal is for everyone to have access to AGI's capabilities, leading to widespread creative and intellectual benefits. <br> <br>

21. ***Deep Cross-Attention for Transformer Enhancement.  <br>UC Irvine, Uni of Southern California and Google's paper introduces DeepCrossAttention (DCA), enhancing transformer residual connections with learnable weights and depth-wise cross-attention. DCA improves information flow, achieving better perplexity and up to 3x faster training with negligible parameter increase.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 10, UC Irvine, Uni of Southern California and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06785) “DeepCrossAttention: Supercharging Transformer Residual Connections”. Transformer networks have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, leveraging a variety of architectural innovations, including residual connections. However, traditional residual connections, which simply sum the outputs of previous layers, can dilute crucial information. This work introduces DeepCrossAttention (DCA), an approach that enhances residual learning in transformers. DCA employs learnable, input-dependent weights to dynamically combine layer outputs, enabling the model to selectively focus on the most relevant information in any of the previous layers. Furthermore, DCA incorporates depth-wise cross-attention, allowing for richer interactions between layers at different depths. The language modeling experiments show that DCA achieves improved perplexity for a given training time. Moreover, DCA obtains the same model quality up to 3x faster while adding a negligible number of parameters. Theoretical analysis confirms that DCA provides an improved trade-off between accuracy and model size when the ratio of collective layer ranks to the ambient dimension falls below a critical threshold. <br> <br>

23. ***RL Scaling for Small Models via Iterative Lengthening.  <br>pretty-raido-b70 blog presents DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview, a 1.5B language model finetuned with reinforcement learning, demonstrating that RL scaling benefits even small models when combined with high-quality distilled SFT data and a novel iterative lengthening scheme, achieving performance surpassing OpenAI’s o1-preview with significantly reduced compute.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 10, pretty-raido-b70 published a [blog](https://pretty-radio-b75.notion.site/DeepScaleR-Surpassing-O1-Preview-with-a-1-5B-Model-by-Scaling-RL-19681902c1468005bed8ca303013a4e2) “DeepScaleR: Surpassing O1-Preview with a 1.5B Model by Scaling RL”. The work introduces DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview, a language model finetuned from Deepseek-R1-Distilled-Qwen-1.5B using simple reinforcement learning (RL). The authors found that directly replicating DeepSeek-R1’s experiments (⩾32K context, ~8000 steps) takes at least 70,000 A100 GPU hours—even for a 1.5B model. To address this, the work leverages a distilled model and introduce a novel iterative lengthening scheme for RL, reducing the compute requirement to just 3,800 A100 GPU hours—an 18.42× reduction—while achieving performance surpassing OpenAI’s o1-preview with just a 1.5B model. Two main takeaways are: 1) RL scaling can manifest in small models as well. Deepseek-R1 demonstrates that applying RL directly on small models is not as effective as distillation. Their ablations shows that RL on Qwen-32B achieves 47% on AIME, whereas distillation alone reaches 72.6%. A common myth is that RL scaling only benefits large models. However, with high-quality SFT data distilled from larger models, smaller models can also learn to reason more effectively with RL. This study’s results confirm this: RL scaling improved AIME accuracy from 28.9% to 43.1%! These findings suggest that neither SFT nor RL alone is sufficient. Instead, by combining high-quality SFT distillation with RL scaling, the study can truly unlock the reasoning potential of LLMs. 2) Iterative lengthening enables more effective length scaling. Prior works indicate that training RL directly on 16K context yields no significant improvement over 8K, likely due to insufficient compute for the model to fully exploit the extended context. And a recent work suggests longer response lengths consists of redundant self-reflection that leads to incorrect results. Experiments are consistent with these findings. By first optimizing reasoning at shorter contexts (8K), the study enables faster and more effective training in subsequent 16K and 24K runs. This iterative approach grounds the model in effective thinking patterns before scaling to longer contexts, making RL-based length scaling more efficient.

25. ***Emergence of Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning Self-Play.  <br>MIT, Cornell Uni, Uni of Washington and Microsoft paper proposes Reinforcement Learning via Self-Play (RLSP) to train Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). RLSP, using exploration rewards and outcome verifiers, encourages emergent reasoning behaviors like backtracking and verification, significantly improving math reasoning performance in models like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 10, MIT, Cornell Uni, Uni of Washington and Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06773) “On the Emergence of Thinking in LLMs I: Searching for the Right Intuition”. Recent AI advancements, such as OpenAI's new models, are transforming LLMs into LRMs (Large Reasoning Models) that perform reasoning during inference, taking extra time and compute for higher-quality outputs. The work aims to uncover the algorithmic framework for training LRMs. Methods like self-consistency, PRM, and AlphaZero suggest reasoning as guided search. This study asks: what is the simplest, most scalable way to enable search in LLMs? The work proposes a post-training framework called Reinforcement Learning via Self-Play (RLSP). RLSP involves three steps: (1) supervised fine-tuning with human or synthetic demonstrations of the reasoning process, (2) using an exploration reward signal to encourage diverse and efficient reasoning behaviors, and (3) RL training with an outcome verifier to ensure correctness while preventing reward hacking. The key innovation is to decouple exploration and correctness signals during PPO training, carefully balancing them to improve performance and efficiency. Empirical studies in the math domain show that RLSP improves reasoning. On the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model, RLSP can boost performance by 23% in MATH-500 test set; On AIME 2024 math problems, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct improved by 10% due to RLSP. However, a more important finding of this work is that the models trained using RLSP, even with the simplest exploration reward that encourages the model to take more intermediate steps, showed several emergent behaviors such as backtracking, exploration of ideas, and verification. These findings demonstrate that RLSP framework might be enough to enable emergence of complex reasoning abilities in LLMs when scaled. Lastly, the study proposes a theory as to why RLSP search strategy is more suitable for LLMs inspired by a remarkable result that says CoT provably increases computational power of LLMs, which grows as the number of steps in CoT.

27. ***Confidence-Informed Self-Consistency for Efficient Reasoning.  <br>Google, The Hebrew Uni and Columbia Uni introduced Confidence-Informed Self-Consistency (CISC), enhancing self-consistency decoding by weighting reasoning paths based on model confidence scores. CISC outperforms self-consistency, reducing the required reasoning paths by over 40% and demonstrating LLMs' ability to judge their own output correctness.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 10, Google, The Hebrew Uni and Columbia Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06233) “Confidence Improves Self-Consistency in LLMs”. Self-consistency decoding enhances LLMs' performance on reasoning tasks by sampling diverse reasoning paths and selecting the most frequent answer. However, it is computationally expensive, as sampling many of these (lengthy) paths is required to increase the chances that the correct answer emerges as the most frequent one. To address this, the work introduces Confidence-Informed Self-Consistency (CISC). CISC performs a weighted majority vote based on confidence scores obtained directly from the model. By prioritizing high-confidence paths, it can identify the correct answer with a significantly smaller sample size. When tested on nine models and four datasets, CISC outperforms self-consistency in nearly all configurations, reducing the required number of reasoning paths by over 40% on average. In addition, the study introduces the notion of within-question confidence evaluation, after showing that standard evaluation methods are poor predictors of success in distinguishing correct and incorrect answers to the same question. In fact, the most calibrated confidence method proved to be the least effective for CISC. Lastly, beyond these practical implications, the results and analyses show that LLMs can effectively judge the correctness of their own outputs, contributing to the ongoing debate on this topic. <br> <br>

29. ***Compute-Optimal Test-Time Scaling Rethought.  <br>Shanghai AI Lab, Tsinghua Uni, Harbin Inst of Tech and BUPT paper re-evaluates Test-Time Scaling (TTS), finding that compute-optimal TTS strategies depend heavily on policy models, PRMs, and problem difficulty.  Their experiments show that with optimal TTS, smaller LLMs can outperform much larger models, suggesting TTS is a promising way to boost reasoning in LLMs.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 10, Shanghai AI Lab, Tsinghua Uni, Harbin Inst of Tech and BUPT published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06703) “Can 1B LLM Surpass 405B LLM? Rethinking Compute-Optimal Test-Time Scaling”. Test-Time Scaling (TTS) is an important method for improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using additional computation during the inference phase. However, current studies do not systematically analyze how policy models, Process Reward Models (PRMs), and problem difficulty influence TTS. This lack of analysis limits the understanding and practical use of TTS methods. This study focuses on two core questions: (1) What is the optimal approach to scale test-time computation across different policy models, PRMs, and problem difficulty levels? (2) To what extent can extended computation improve the performance of LLMs on complex tasks, and can smaller language models outperform larger ones through this approach? Through comprehensive experiments on MATH-500 and challenging AIME24 tasks, the study has the following observations: (1) The compute-optimal TTS strategy is highly dependent on the choice of policy model, PRM, and problem difficulty. (2) With the compute-optimal TTS strategy, extremely small policy models can outperform larger models. For example, a 1B LLM can exceed a 405B LLM on MATH-500. Moreover, on both MATH-500 and AIME24, a 0.5B LLM outperforms GPT-4o, a 3B LLM surpasses a 405B LLM, and a 7B LLM beats o1 and DeepSeek-R1, while with higher inference efficiency. These findings show the significance of adapting TTS strategies to the specific characteristics of each task and model and indicate that TTS is a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. website is available at https://ryanliu112.github.io/compute-optimal-tts. <br> <br>

    Feb 10, according to [windowscentral.com](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/bill-gates-hide-from-the-press-if-steve-ballmer-traded-for-windows-10), Sam Altman doubts he'll be smarter than GPT-5 after promising the model would outperform the "mildly embarrassing" GPT-4 with "high scientific certainty". According to reddit, Sam Altman says OpenAI has an internal AI model that is the 50th best competitive programmer in the world, and later this year it will be #1. <br> <br>

33. ***Matryoshka Quantization for Multi-Scale Serving.  <br>Google's paper introduces Matryoshka Quantization (MatQuant), a novel technique allowing a single model to serve at different precision levels by leveraging the nested structure of integer data types. MatQuant improves int2 quantization accuracy by up to 10% through co-training and co-distillation, enabling more efficient and accurate low-precision models.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 10, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06786) “Matryoshka Quantization”. Quantizing model weights is critical for reducing the communication and inference costs of large models. However, quantizing models -- especially to low precisions like int4 or int2 -- requires a trade-off in model quality; int2, in particular, is known to severely degrade model quality. Consequently, practitioners are often forced to maintain multiple models with different quantization levels or serve a single model that best satisfies the quality-latency trade-off. On the other hand, integer data types, such as int8, inherently possess a nested (Matryoshka) structure where smaller bit-width integers, like int4 or int2, are nested within the most significant bits. This paper proposes Matryoshka Quantization (MatQuant), a novel multi-scale quantization technique that addresses the challenge of needing multiple quantized models. It allows training and maintaining just one model, which can then be served at different precision levels. Furthermore, due to the co-training and co-distillation regularization provided by MatQuant, the int2 precision models extracted by MatQuant can be up to 10% more accurate than standard int2 quantization (using techniques like QAT or OmniQuant). This represents significant progress in model quantization, demonstrated by the fact that, with the same recipe, an int2 FFN-quantized Gemma-2 9B model is more accurate than an int8 FFN-quantized Gemma-2 2B model. <br> <br>

35. ***Hierarchical Reasoning via Scaled Thought Templates.  <br>Princeton Uni and Peking Uni paper presents ReasonFlux-32B, a model using hierarchical LLM reasoning via scaled thought templates to outperform powerful LLMs in mathematical reasoning. ReasonFlux-32B utilizes a thought template library, hierarchical reinforcement learning, and an inference scaling system to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on MATH and AIME benchmarks.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 10, Princeton Uni and Peking Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06772) “ReasonFlux: Hierarchical LLM Reasoning via Scaling Thought Templates”. The work presents that hierarchical LLM reasoning via scaling thought templates can effectively optimize the reasoning search space and outperform the mathematical reasoning capabilities of powerful LLMs like OpenAI o1-preview and DeepSeek V3. The study trains the ReasonFlux-32B model with only 8 GPUs and introduces three innovations: (i) a structured and generic thought template library, containing around 500 high-level thought templates capable of generalizing to similar or relevant reasoning problems; (ii) performing hierarchical reinforcement learning on a sequence of thought templates instead of long CoTs, optimizing a base LLM to plan out an optimal template trajectory for gradually handling complex problems; (iii) a brand new inference scaling system that enables hierarchical LLM reasoning by adaptively scaling thought templates at inference time. With a template trajectory containing sequential thought templates, the ReasonFlux-32B significantly advances math reasoning capabilities to state-of-the-art levels. Notably, on the MATH benchmark, it achieves an accuracy of 91.2% and surpasses o1-preview by 6.7%. On the USA Math Olympiad (AIME) benchmark, ReasonFlux-32B solves an average of 56.7% of problems, surpassing o1-preview and DeepSeek-V3 by 27% and 45%, respectively.

37. ***Large Memory Models for Enhanced Reasoning.  <br>Convergence Labs Ltd introduces Large Memory Models (LM2), a Transformer architecture augmented with an auxiliary memory module to improve multi-step reasoning and information synthesis over long contexts. LM2 outperforms standard Transformers on benchmarks like BABILong and MMLU, showcasing enhanced capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 9, Convergence Labs Ltd published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06049) “LM2: Large Memory Models”. This paper introduces the Large Memory Model (LM2), a decoder-only Transformer architecture enhanced with an auxiliary memory module that aims to address the limitations of standard Transformers in multi-step reasoning, relational argumentation, and synthesizing information distributed over long contexts. The proposed LM2 incorporates a memory module that acts as a contextual representation repository, interacting with input tokens via cross attention and updating through gating mechanisms. To preserve the Transformers general-purpose capabilities, LM2 maintains the original information flow while integrating a complementary memory pathway. Experimental results on the BABILong benchmark demonstrate that the LM2model outperforms both the memory-augmented RMT model by 37.1% and the baseline Llama-3.2 model by 86.3% on average across tasks. LM2 exhibits exceptional capabilities in multi-hop inference, numerical reasoning, and large-context question-answering. On the MMLU dataset, it achieves a 5.0% improvement over a pre-trained vanilla model, demonstrating that its memory module does not degrade performance on general tasks. Further, in the analysis, the study explores the memory interpretability, effectiveness of memory modules, and test-time behavior. The findings emphasize the importance of explicit memory in enhancing Transformer architectures. <br> <br>

39. ***Social Deduction Language Models via MARL.  <br>Stanford Uni paper trains language models for social deduction games through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) without human demonstrations. By decomposing communication into listening and speaking and using agent goals as rewards, they achieve strong natural language discussions and improved win rates in an Among Us-inspired game.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 9, Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06060) “Training Language Models for Social Deduction with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning”. Communicating in natural language is a powerful tool in multi-agent settings, as it enables independent agents to share information in partially observable settings and allows zero-shot coordination with humans. However, most prior works are limited as they either rely on training with large amounts of human demonstrations or lack the ability to generate natural and useful communication strategies. This study trains language models to have productive discussions about their environment in natural language without any human demonstrations. The study decomposes the communication problem into listening and speaking. The key idea is to leverage the agent's goal to predict useful information about the world as a dense reward signal that guides communication. Specifically, the work improves a model's listening skills by training them to predict information about the environment based on discussions, and simultaneously improves a model's speaking skills with multi-agent reinforcement learning by rewarding messages based on their influence on other agents. To investigate the role and necessity of communication in complex social settings, the authors study an embodied social deduction game based on Among Us, where the key question to answer is the identity of an adversarial imposter. The study analyzes emergent behaviors due to the technique, such as accusing suspects and providing evidence, and find that it enables strong discussions, doubling the win rates compared to standard RL.

41. ***Multi-Faceted Scaling Law Dataset.  <br>Uni of Maryland and Columbia Uni paper releases Gemstones, a comprehensive open-source scaling law dataset with over 4000 transformer checkpoints trained with varied hyperparameters and architectures.  Their analysis reveals that scaling law prescriptions are sensitive to experimental design and checkpoint selection, enabling more complex scaling law studies.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 8, Uni of Maryland and Columbia Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06857) “Gemstones: A Model Suite for Multi-Faceted Scaling Laws”. Scaling laws are typically fit using a family of models with a narrow range of frozen hyper-parameter choices. The work studies scaling laws using a wide range of architecture and hyper-parameter choices, and highlight their impact on resulting prescriptions. As a primary artifact of the research, the authors release the Gemstones: the most comprehensive open-source scaling law dataset to date, consisting of over 4000 checkpoints from transformers with up to 2 billion parameters; these models have been trained with different learning rates, cooldown schedules, and architectural shapes. The checkpoints enable more complex studies of scaling, such as a law that predicts language modeling performance as a function of model width and depth. By examining the various facets of the model suite, the study finds that the prescriptions of scaling laws can be highly sensitive to the experimental design process and the specific model checkpoints used during fitting.

43. ***Entropy-Based Temperature Optimization for LLMs.  <br>CMU paper addresses temperature selection for multi-sample inference in LLMs by proposing a novel entropy-based metric for automated temperature optimization. Their approach, validated across models and tasks, outperforms fixed-temperature baselines without task-specific validation data, providing insights into temperature's role in model performance.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 7, CMU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05234) “Optimizing Temperature for Language Models with Multi-Sample Inference”. Multi-sample aggregation strategies, such as majority voting and best-of-N sampling, are widely used in contemporary large language models (LLMs) to enhance predictive accuracy across various tasks. A key challenge in this process is temperature selection, which significantly impacts model performance. Existing approaches either rely on a fixed default temperature or require labeled validation data for tuning, which are often scarce and difficult to obtain. This paper addresses the challenge of automatically identifying the (near)-optimal temperature for different LLMs using multi-sample aggregation strategies, without relying on task-specific validation data. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of temperature's role in performance optimization, considering variations in model architectures, datasets, task types, model sizes, and predictive accuracy. Furthermore, the work proposes a novel entropy-based metric for automated temperature optimization, which consistently outperforms fixed-temperature baselines. Additionally, the study incorporates a stochastic process model to enhance interpretability, offering deeper insights into the relationship between temperature and model performance. <br> <br>

45. ***Recurrent Depth for Scalable Test-Time Compute.  <br>ELLIS, Uni of Maryland and Lawrence Livermore National Lab paper introduces a language model architecture capable of scaling test-time computation through latent space reasoning with a recurrent block. This recurrent depth approach improves performance on reasoning benchmarks, sometimes dramatically, without specialized training data or large context windows, achieving gains equivalent to scaling model parameters significantly.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 7, ELLIS, Uni of Maryland and Lawrence Livermore National Lab published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05171) “Scaling up Test-Time Compute with Latent Reasoning: A Recurrent Depth Approach”. The paper studies a novel language model architecture that is capable of scaling test-time computation by implicitly reasoning in latent space. The model works by iterating a recurrent block, thereby unrolling to arbitrary depth at test-time. This stands in contrast to mainstream reasoning models that scale up compute by producing more tokens. Unlike approaches based on chain-of-thought, the approach does not require any specialized training data, can work with small context windows, and can capture types of reasoning that are not easily represented in words. The work scales a proof-of-concept model to 3.5 billion parameters and 800 billion tokens, and shows that the resulting model can improve its performance on reasoning benchmarks, sometimes dramatically, up to a computation load equivalent to 50 billion parameters. <br> <br>

47. ***No Literal Match Long-Context Benchmark.  <br>LMU Munich, Munich Center for ML and Adobe introduced NoLiMa, a benchmark to evaluate long-context LLMs beyond literal matching in needle-in-a-haystack tests. NoLiMa uses needles with minimal lexical overlap to haystacks, forcing models to infer latent associations, revealing that many LLMs' performance significantly degrades in longer contexts (>32K) even for top models like GPT-4o.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 7, LMU Munich, Munich Center for ML and Adobe published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05167) “NoLiMa: Long-Context Evaluation Beyond Literal Matching”. Recent large language models (LLMs) support long contexts ranging from 128K to 1M tokens. A popular method for evaluating these capabilities is the needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) test, which involves retrieving a "needle" (relevant information) from a "haystack" (long irrelevant context). Extensions of this approach include increasing distractors, fact chaining, and in-context reasoning. However, in these benchmarks, models can exploit existing literal matches between the needle and haystack to simplify the task. To address this, the study introduces NoLiMa, a benchmark extending NIAH with a carefully designed needle set, where questions and needles have minimal lexical overlap, requiring models to infer latent associations to locate the needle within the haystack. The study evaluates 12 popular LLMs that claim to support contexts of at least 128K tokens. While they perform well in short contexts (<1K), performance degrades significantly as context length increases. At 32K, for instance, 10 models drop below 50% of their strong short-length baselines. Even GPT-4o, one of the top-performing exceptions, experiences a reduction from an almost-perfect baseline of 99.3% to 69.7%. The analysis suggests these declines stem from the increased difficulty the attention mechanism faces in longer contexts when literal matches are absent, making it harder to retrieve relevant information. <br> <br>

49. ***Efficient Reasoning Training via RL.  <br>CMU's paper proposes training large reasoning models for efficiency using reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically allocate inference compute based on task complexity. This method reduces computational overhead while maintaining accuracy, creating models with varying efficiency levels controlled by a hyperparameter, demonstrating significant inference cost reductions on open-weight reasoning models.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 6, CMU published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04463) “Training Language Models to Reason Efficiently”. Scaling model size and training data has led to great advances in the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the diminishing returns of this approach necessitate alternative methods to improve model capabilities, particularly in tasks requiring advanced reasoning. Large reasoning models, which leverage long chain-of-thoughts, bring unprecedented breakthroughs in problem-solving capabilities but at a substantial deployment cost associated to longer generations. Reducing inference costs is crucial for the economic feasibility, user experience, and environmental sustainability of these models. This study proposes to train large reasoning models to reason efficiently. More precisely, the study uses reinforcement learning (RL) to train reasoning models to dynamically allocate inference-time compute based on task complexity. The method incentivizes models to minimize unnecessary computational overhead while maintaining accuracy, thereby achieving substantial efficiency gains. It enables the derivation of a family of reasoning models with varying efficiency levels, controlled via a single hyperparameter. Experiments on two open-weight large reasoning models demonstrate significant reductions in inference cost while preserving most of the accuracy. <br> <br>

51. ***Predictable Scaling of Value-Based RL.  <br>UC Berkeley, Uni of Warsaw and CMU research demonstrates that value-based off-policy RL methods scale predictably, showing data and compute requirements lie on a Pareto frontier controlled by the updates-to-data (UTD) ratio. By estimating this frontier and managing overfitting and plasticity loss, they can predict data needs for increased compute and vice-versa, validated across various RL algorithms and environments.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 6, UC Berkeley, Uni of Warsaw and CMU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04327) “Value-Based Deep RL Scales Predictably”. Scaling data and compute is critical to the success of machine learning. However, scaling demands predictability: people want methods to not only perform well with more compute or data, but also have their performance be predictable from small-scale runs, without running the large-scale experiment. This study shows that value-based off-policy RL methods are predictable despite community lore regarding their pathological behavior. First, the study shows that data and compute requirements to attain a given performance level lie on a Pareto frontier, controlled by the updates-to-data (UTD) ratio. By estimating this frontier, the study can predict this data requirement when given more compute, and this compute requirement when given more data. Second, the study determines the optimal allocation of a total resource budget across data and compute for a given performance and use it to determine hyperparameters that maximize performance for a given budget. Third, this scaling behavior is enabled by first estimating predictable relationships between hyperparameters, which is used to manage effects of overfitting and plasticity loss unique to RL. The study validates the approach using three algorithms: SAC, BRO, and PQL on DeepMind Control, OpenAI gym, and IsaacGym, when extrapolating to higher levels of data, compute, budget, or performance. <br> <br>

53. ***Multi-LLM Collaboration for Complex Tasks.  <br>Uni of Washington, et al., argue for multi-LLM collaboration as essential for reliable outputs in complex, subjective scenarios. They propose that single LLMs underrepresent real-world diversity and present a hierarchy of multi-LLM collaboration methods, highlighting their benefits in reliability, democratization, and pluralism while identifying future research directions.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 6, Uni of Washington, Uni of Texas at Austin, Google, MIT and Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04506) “When One LLM Drools, Multi-LLM Collaboration Rules”. This position paper argues that in many realistic (i.e., complex, contextualized, subjective) scenarios, one LLM is not enough to produce a reliable output. The authors challenge the status quo of relying solely on a single general-purpose LLM and argue for multi-LLM collaboration to better represent the extensive diversity of data, skills, and people. The paper first posits that a single LLM underrepresents real-world data distributions, heterogeneous skills, and pluralistic populations, and that such representation gaps cannot be trivially patched by further training a single LLM. The authors then organize existing multi-LLM collaboration methods into a hierarchy, based on the level of access and information exchange, ranging from API-level, text-level, logit-level, to weight-level collaboration. Based on these methods, the authors highlight how multi-LLM collaboration addresses challenges that a single LLM struggles with, such as reliability, democratization, and pluralism. Finally, the authors identify the limitations of existing multi-LLM methods and motivate future work. The study envisions multi-LLM collaboration as an essential path toward compositional intelligence and collaborative AI development. <br> <br>

55. ***LLMs as Meeting Delegates Benchmarked.  <br>Microsoft et al. benchmarked LLMs as meeting delegates using real meeting transcripts, evaluating GPT-4/4o, Gemini, and Llama3. They found GPT-4/4o balances engagement strategies, while Gemini 1.5 Pro is cautious and others are more active, with about 60% of responses addressing key points, but needing improvements in relevance and error tolerance for practical use.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 5, Microsoft et al published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04376) “MEETING DELEGATE: Benchmarking LLMs on Attending Meetings on Our Behalf”. In contemporary workplaces, meetings are essential for exchanging ideas and ensuring team alignment but often face challenges such as time consumption, scheduling conflicts, and inefficient participation. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their strong capabilities in natural language generation and reasoning, prompting the question: can LLMs effectively delegate participants in meetings? To explore this, the study develops a prototype LLM-powered meeting delegate system and create a comprehensive benchmark using real meeting transcripts. The evaluation reveals that GPT-4/4o maintain balanced performance between active and cautious engagement strategies. In contrast, Gemini 1.5 Pro tends to be more cautious, while Gemini 1.5 Flash and Llama3-8B/70B display more active tendencies. Overall, about 60% of responses address at least one key point from the ground-truth. However, improvements are needed to reduce irrelevant or repetitive content and enhance tolerance for transcription errors commonly found in real-world settings. Additionally, the work implements the system in practical settings and collect real-world feedback from demos. The findings underscore the potential and challenges of utilizing LLMs as meeting delegates, offering valuable insights into their practical application for alleviating the burden of meetings. <br> <br>

57. ***Homomorphic KV-Cache Compression for Efficient LLM Inference.  <br>Uni of Virginia, et al., introduced HACK, a method for Homomorphic Acceleration via Compression of the Key-Value cache in disaggregated LLM inference. HACK directly computes on quantized KV data, eliminating dequantization overhead and reducing Job Completion Time by up to 70.9% compared to baseline and 52.3% over state-of-the-art quantization methods.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 5, Uni of Virginia, VMWare, UCL and Harvard Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03589) “HACK: Homomorphic Acceleration via Compression of the Key-Value Cache for Disaggregated LLM Inference”. Disaggregated Large Language Model (LLM) inference has gained popularity as it separates the computation-intensive prefill stage from the memory-intensive decode stage, avoiding the prefill-decode interference and improving resource utilization. However, transmitting Key-Value (KV) data between the two stages can be a bottleneck, especially for long prompts. Additionally, the computation time overhead for prefill and decode is key for optimizing Job Completion Time (JCT), and KV data size can become prohibitive for long prompts and sequences. Existing KV quantization methods can alleviate the transmission bottleneck and reduce memory requirements, but they introduce significant dequantization overhead, exacerbating the computation time. The study proposes Homomorphic Acceleration via Compression of the KV cache (HACK) for disaggregated LLM inference. HACK eliminates the heavy KV dequantization step, and directly performs computations on quantized KV data to approximate and reduce the cost of the expensive matrix-multiplication step. Extensive trace-driven experiments show that HACK reduces JCT by up to 70.9% compared to disaggregated LLM inference baseline and by up to 52.3% compared to state-of-the-art KV quantization methods. <br> <br>

59. ***Scaled RL Outperforms Domain-Specific Competitive Programming AI.  <br>OpenAI's paper shows reinforcement learning significantly improves LLM performance in complex coding and reasoning. Their scaled-up general-purpose model o3, trained with RL, outperforms a hand-engineered domain-specific system (o1-ioi) in competitive programming, achieving a gold medal at IOI 2024 and elite Codeforces rating without specialized techniques.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 3, OpenAI published a [paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.06807) “Competitive Programming with Large Reasoning Models”. The study shows that reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLMs) significantly boosts performance on complex coding and reasoning tasks. Additionally, the study compares two general-purpose reasoning models - OpenAI o1 and an early checkpoint of o3 - with a domain-specific system, o1-ioi, which uses hand-engineered inference strategies designed for competing in the 2024 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). The authors competed live at IOI 2024 with o1-ioi and, using hand-crafted test-time strategies, placed in the 49th percentile. Under relaxed competition constraints, o1-ioi achieved a gold medal. However, when evaluating later models such as o3, o3 achieves gold without hand-crafted domain-specific strategies or relaxed constraints. The findings show that although specialized pipelines such as o1-ioi yield solid improvements, the scaled-up, general-purpose o3 model surpasses those results without relying on hand-crafted inference heuristics. Notably, o3 achieves a gold medal at the 2024 IOI and obtains a Codeforces rating on par with elite human competitors. Overall, these results indicate that scaling general-purpose reinforcement learning, rather than relying on domain-specific techniques, offers a robust path toward state-of-the-art AI in reasoning domains, such as competitive programming. <br> <br>

61. ***VLM-in-the-Loop Policy Steering via Latent Alignment.  <br>CMU and UC Berkeley proposed FOREWARN, a framework for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to steer robot policies by decoupling foresight and forethought. FOREWARN uses a latent world model for foresight and aligns the VLM with latent states for forethought, enabling robust, generalizable policy steering in robotic manipulation tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 3, CMU and UC Berkeley published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01828) “From Foresight to Forethought: VLM-In-the-Loop Policy Steering via Latent Alignment”. While generative robot policies have demonstrated significant potential in learning complex, multimodal behaviors from demonstrations, they still exhibit diverse failures at deployment-time. Policy steering offers an elegant solution to reducing the chance of failure by using an external verifier to select from low-level actions proposed by an imperfect generative policy. Here, one might hope to use a Vision Language Model (VLM) as a verifier, leveraging its open-world reasoning capabilities. However, off-the-shelf VLMs struggle to understand the consequences of low-level robot actions as they are represented fundamentally differently than the text and images the VLM was trained on. In response, the study proposes FOREWARN, a novel framework to unlock the potential of VLMs as open-vocabulary verifiers for runtime policy steering. The key idea is to decouple the VLM's burden of predicting action outcomes (foresight) from evaluation (forethought). For foresight, the study leverages a latent world model to imagine future latent states given diverse low-level action plans. For forethought, the work aligns the VLM with these predicted latent states to reason about the consequences of actions in its native representation--natural language--and effectively filter proposed plans. The study validates the framework across diverse robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating its ability to bridge representational gaps and provide robust, generalizable policy steering. <br> <br>

63. ***Trigonometry in LLM Addition.  <br>MIT research reverse-engineered how LLMs perform addition, discovering numbers are represented as generalized helices. They propose the "Clock" algorithm where LLMs manipulate these helices using trigonometry to compute sums, providing a representation-level explanation of LLM mathematical capabilities through causal interventions.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 2, MIT published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00873) “Language Models Use Trigonometry to Do Addition”. Mathematical reasoning is an increasingly important indicator of large language model (LLM) capabilities, yet people lack understanding of how LLMs process even simple mathematical tasks. To address this, the study reverses engineer how three mid-sized LLMs compute addition. The study first discovers that numbers are represented in these LLMs as a generalized helix, which is strongly causally implicated for the tasks of addition and subtraction, and is also causally relevant for integer division, multiplication, and modular arithmetic. The study then proposes that LLMs compute addition by manipulating this generalized helix using the "Clock" algorithm: to solve a+b, the helices for a and b are manipulated to produce the a+b answer helix which is then read out to model logits. The study models influential MLP outputs, attention head outputs, and even individual neuron preactivations with these helices and verify the understanding with causal interventions. By demonstrating that LLMs represent numbers on a helix and manipulate this helix to perform addition, the study presents the first representation-level explanation of an LLM's mathematical capability.

1. ***ChatGPT’s Legal Analysis Gaps Exposed:  <br>The Verge tested ChatGPT’s “deep research” feature on Section 230 analysis. While it accurately summarized recent rulings, it lacked context and omitted key 2024 legal decisions. Legal experts noted its promise but highlighted reliability concerns for complex legal tasks*** <br> <br>
   Feb 7, Theverge.com published an [article](https://www.theverge.com/openai/607587/chatgpt-deep-research-hands-on-section-230) “I tested ChatGPT’s deep research with the most misunderstood law on the internet It got the facts right but the story wrong”. The author tested ChatGPT's new "deep research" feature on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law often misunderstood. While ChatGPT accurately summarized recent court rulings, it missed broader points and ignored significant legal decisions from the past year. The deep research feature, available with a $200/month Pro tier, searches the web for fresh information. The author enlisted legal expert Eric Goldman to review the results, who found the summaries largely accurate but lacking context and missing key developments from 2024. ChatGPT's report covered 2019 to 2024 but omitted crucial rulings from 2024, leading to an incomplete picture. Despite these issues, the technology shows promise but requires careful oversight and may not yet be fully reliable for complex legal analysis. <br> <br>

3. ***OpenAI’s Tool Divides Scientists:  <br>Nature explored OpenAI’s “deep research” tool, which synthesizes cited reports. Scientists praised its efficiency for literature reviews but criticized citation errors, paywall limitations, and struggles to filter authoritative sources. Google’s similar tool faced comparable critiques*** <br> <br>
   Feb 6, Nature published an [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00377-9) “OpenAI’s ‘deep research’ tool: is it useful for scientists?”. OpenAI has introduced a pay-for-access tool called 'deep research' that synthesizes information from numerous websites into a cited report. This tool, similar to one released by Google, acts as a personal assistant, performing hours of work in minutes. Scientists have mixed reactions; some praise its ability to write literature reviews and identify knowledge gaps, while others find it lacking. The tool combines the reasoning skills of OpenAI's o3 large language model with internet search capabilities. Google's version uses the Gemini 1.5 Pro model. Users appreciate the tools for quickly getting up to speed on topics and updating human-authored reviews. However, concerns remain about inaccuracies, citation errors, and distinguishing authoritative information from rumors. OpenAI acknowledges these limitations and expects improvements over time. The tool performed well on benchmark tests like Humanity's Last Exam and the GAIA benchmark, but it cannot access paywalled information, which is a significant drawback. Despite these issues, the tools represent a step towards AI agents capable of handling complex tasks, though they are not yet equivalent to human research. <br> <br>

5. ***New LLM Alignment Method Emerges:  <br>A paper introduced LarPO, a novel LLM alignment approach inspired by information retrieval. It improved AlpacaEval2 performance by 38.9%, offering a simpler alternative to reinforcement learning methods. Researchers emphasized its potential for ethical AI development*** <br> <br>
   Feb 6, Google, UIUC and Uni of Virginia published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03699) “LLM Alignment as Retriever Optimization: An Information Retrieval Perspective”. Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence with capabilities in reasoning, coding, and communication, driving innovation across industries. Their true potential depends on effective alignment to ensure correct, trustworthy and ethical behavior, addressing challenges like misinformation, hallucinations, bias and misuse. While existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based alignment methods are notoriously complex, direct optimization approaches offer a simpler alternative. This study introduces a novel direct optimization approach for LLM alignment by drawing on established Information Retrieval (IR) principles. The study presents a systematic framework that bridges LLM alignment and IR methodologies, mapping LLM generation and reward models to IR's retriever-reranker paradigm. Building on this foundation, the work proposes LLM Alignment as Retriever Preference Optimization (LarPO), a new alignment method that enhances overall alignment quality. Extensive experiments validate LarPO's effectiveness with 38.9 % and 13.7 % averaged improvement on AlpacaEval2 and MixEval-Hard respectively. The work opens new avenues for advancing LLM alignment by integrating IR foundations, offering a promising direction for future research. <br> <br>

7. ***AI Oversight Risks From Model Similarity:  <br>A study found that AI oversight systems favor models with overlapping errors, risking correlated failures. As models grow more capable, their mistakes become harder to detect, undermining supervision efforts. Authors urged transparency in similarity metrics*** <br> <br>
   Feb 6, ELLIS Inst Tubingen et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04313) “Great Models Think Alike and this Undermines AI Oversight”. As Language Model (LM) capabilities advance, evaluating and supervising them at scale is getting harder for humans. There is hope that other language models can automate both these tasks, which is referred to as "AI Oversight". The authors study how model similarity affects both aspects of AI oversight by proposing a probabilistic metric for LM similarity based on overlap in model mistakes. Using this metric, the work first shows that LLM-as-a-judge scores favor models similar to the judge, generalizing recent self-preference results. Then, the work studies training on LM annotations, and find complementary knowledge between the weak supervisor and strong student model plays a crucial role in gains from "weak-to-strong generalization". As model capabilities increase, it becomes harder to find their mistakes, and it might defer more to AI oversight. However, the study observes a concerning trend -- model mistakes are becoming more similar with increasing capabilities, pointing to risks from correlated failures. The work underscores the importance of reporting and correcting for model similarity, especially in the emerging paradigm of AI oversight. <br> <br>

9. ***ScoreFlow Boosts Multi-Agent Efficiency:  <br>The ScoreFlow framework improved LLM agent workflows via gradient-based optimization, achieving an 8.2% performance gain across benchmarks. It enabled smaller models to outperform larger ones, reducing inference costs*** <br> <br>
    Feb 6, Uni of Chicago, Princeton Uni and Uni of Oxford published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04306) “ScoreFlow: Mastering LLM Agent Workflows via Score-based Preference Optimization”. Recent research has leveraged large language model multi-agent systems for complex problem-solving while trying to reduce the manual effort required to build them, driving the development of automated agent workflow optimization methods. However, existing methods remain inflexible due to representational limitations, a lack of adaptability, and poor scalability when relying on discrete optimization techniques. The study addresses these challenges with ScoreFlow, a simple yet high-performance framework that leverages efficient gradient-based optimization in a continuous space. ScoreFlow incorporates Score-DPO, a novel variant of the direct preference optimization method that accounts for quantitative feedback. Across six benchmarks spanning question answering, coding, and mathematical reasoning, ScoreFlow achieves an 8.2% improvement over existing baselines. Moreover, it empowers smaller models to outperform larger ones with lower inference costs. Project: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/ScoreFlow <br> <br>

In December, the agentic era began with the release of Gemini 2.0 Flash, an efficient model for developers with low latency and enhanced performance. This model was later updated to improve its ability to handle complex problems. Recently, the updated 2.0 Flash was made available to all users of the Gemini app on desktop and mobile. Today, it is generally available via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI, allowing developers to build production applications. Additionally, an experimental version of Gemini 2.0 Pro, designed for coding performance and complex prompts, is now available. A new cost-efficient model, Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, has also been released in public preview. All these models support multimodal input with text output, with more modalities to be added soon. The Flash series, introduced at I/O 2024, is popular for high-volume tasks and multimodal reasoning. The 2.0 Flash model is now generally available with improved performance, and image generation and text-to-speech features are coming soon. The experimental 2.0 Pro model, with a large context window and tool-calling capabilities, is available for developers and advanced users. The 2.0 Flash-Lite model offers better quality at the same speed and cost as its predecessor. The Gemini model family continues to focus on safety and security, using reinforcement learning and automated red teaming to handle sensitive prompts and assess risks. <br> <br>

13. ***LIMO Challenges Data-Intensive Training:  <br>A study showed complex reasoning (94.8% on MATH) could be achieved with just 817 curated examples, defying assumptions about massive datasets. The “LIMO Hypothesis” posits pre-trained knowledge enables minimal-data fine-tuning*** <br> <br>
    Feb 5, GAIR and CMU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03387) “LIMO: Less is More for Reasoning”. The study presents a fundamental discovery that challenges the understanding of how complex reasoning emerges in large language models. While conventional wisdom suggests that sophisticated reasoning tasks demand extensive training data (>100,000 examples), the study demonstrates that complex mathematical reasoning abilities can be effectively elicited with surprisingly few examples. Through comprehensive experiments, the proposed model LIMO demonstrates unprecedented performance in mathematical reasoning. With merely 817 curated training samples, LIMO achieves 57.1% accuracy on AIME and 94.8% on MATH, improving from previous SFT-based models' 6.5% and 59.2% respectively, while only using 1% of the training data required by previous approaches. LIMO demonstrates exceptional out-of-distribution generalization, achieving 40.5% absolute improvement across 10 diverse benchmarks, outperforming models trained on 100x more data, challenging the notion that SFT leads to memorization rather than generalization. Based on these results, the study proposes the Less-Is-More Reasoning Hypothesis (LIMO Hypothesis): In foundation models where domain knowledge has been comprehensively encoded during pre-training, sophisticated reasoning capabilities can emerge through minimal but precisely orchestrated demonstrations of cognitive processes. This hypothesis posits that the elicitation threshold for complex reasoning is determined by two key factors: (1) the completeness of the model's encoded knowledge foundation during pre-training, and (2) the effectiveness of post-training examples as "cognitive templates" that show the model how to utilize its knowledge base to solve complex reasoning tasks. To facilitate reproducibility and future research in data-efficient reasoning, the authors release LIMO as a comprehensive open-source suite at [this https URL](https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/LIMO). <br> <br>

15. ***AlphaGeometry2 Beats Gold Medalists:  <br>An upgraded system solved 84% of Olympiad geometry problems (vs. 54% earlier), matching human gold medalists. Enhancements included extended problem coverage and Gemini-powered search*** <br> <br>
    Feb 5, Google, Uni of Cambridge, Georgia Inst of Tech and Brown Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03544) “Gold-medalist Performance in Solving Olympiad Geometry with AlphaGeometry2”. The study presents AlphaGeometry2, a significantly improved version of AlphaGeometry introduced in Trinh et al. (2024), which has now surpassed an average gold medalist in solving Olympiad geometry problems. To achieve this, the study first extends the original AlphaGeometry language to tackle harder problems involving movements of objects, and problems containing linear equations of angles, ratios, and distances. This, together with other additions, has markedly improved the coverage rate of the AlphaGeometry language on International Math Olympiads (IMO) 2000-2024 geometry problems from 66% to 88%. The search process of AlphaGeometry2 has also been greatly improved through the use of Gemini architecture for better language modeling, and a novel knowledge-sharing mechanism that combines multiple search trees. Together with further enhancements to the symbolic engine and synthetic data generation, the study has significantly boosted the overall solving rate of AlphaGeometry2 to 84% for all geometry problems over the last 25 years, compared to 54% previously. AlphaGeometry2 was also part of the system that achieved silver-medal standard at IMO 2024 https://dpmd.ai/imo-silver. Last but not least, the authors report progress towards using AlphaGeometry2 as a part of a fully automated system that reliably solves geometry problems directly from natural language input. <br> <br>

17. ***LLM Benchmarks Miss Reliability:  <br>MIT found label errors plague current benchmarks, masking model flaws. Proposed “platinum benchmarks” revealed persistent failures in frontier models on simple tasks like elementary math*** <br> <br>
    Feb 5, MIT published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03461) “Do Large Language Model Benchmarks Test Reliability?”. When deploying large language models (LLMs), it is important to ensure that these models are not only capable, but also reliable. Many benchmarks have been created to track LLMs' growing capabilities, however there has been no similar focus on measuring their reliability. To understand the potential ramifications of this gap, the study investigates how well current benchmarks quantify model reliability. The work finds that pervasive label errors can compromise these evaluations, obscuring lingering model failures and hiding unreliable behavior. Motivated by this gap in the evaluation of reliability, the authors then propose the concept of so-called platinum benchmarks, i.e., benchmarks carefully curated to minimize label errors and ambiguity. As a first attempt at constructing such benchmarks, the study revises examples from fifteen existing popular benchmarks, and evaluates a wide range of models on these platinum benchmarks and finds that, indeed, frontier LLMs still exhibit failures on simple tasks such as elementary-level math word problems. Analyzing these failures further reveals previously unidentified patterns of problems on which frontier models consistently struggle.

19. ***Multi-Agent Design Automated:  <br>Google/Cambridge’s MASS framework optimized prompts and topologies for LLM agents, outperforming existing systems. Insights included prioritizing local-to-global optimization stages*** <br> <br>
    Feb 4, Google and Uni of Cambridge published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02533) “Multi-Agent Design: Optimizing Agents with Better Prompts and Topologies”. Large language models, employed as multiple agents that interact and collaborate with each other, have excelled at solving complex tasks. The agents are programmed with prompts that declare their functionality, along with the topologies that orchestrate interactions across agents. Designing prompts and topologies for multi-agent systems (MAS) is inherently complex. To automate the entire design process, the study first conducts an in-depth analysis of the design space aiming to understand the factors behind building effective MAS. The study reveals that prompts together with topologies play critical roles in enabling more effective MAS design. Based on the insights, the work proposes Multi-Agent System Search (MASS), a MAS optimization framework that efficiently exploits the complex MAS design space by interleaving its optimization stages, from local to global, from prompts to topologies, over three stages: 1) block-level (local) prompt optimization; 2) workflow topology optimization; 3) workflow-level (global) prompt optimization, where each stage is conditioned on the iteratively optimized prompts/topologies from former stages. The study shows that MASS-optimized multi-agent systems outperform a spectrum of existing alternatives by a substantial margin. Based on the MASS-found systems, the study finally proposes design principles behind building effective multi-agent systems. <br> <br>

21. ***KV Cache Compression Harms Reasoning:  <br>Aggressive compression degraded arithmetic reasoning by 17-43%, but distillation improved robustness. Proposed ShotKV method boosted long-context performance by 9-18%*** <br> <br>
    Feb 4, HKUST published a [paper](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01941) “Can LLMs Maintain Fundamental Abilities under KV Cache Compression?”. This paper investigates an under-explored challenge in large language models (LLMs): the impact of KV cache compression methods on LLMs' fundamental capabilities. While existing methods achieve impressive compression ratios on long-context benchmarks, their effects on core model capabilities remain understudied. The study presents a comprehensive empirical study evaluating prominent KV cache compression methods across diverse tasks, spanning world knowledge, commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, code generation, safety, and long-context understanding and generation. The analysis reveals that KV cache compression methods exhibit task-specific performance degradation. Arithmetic reasoning tasks prove particularly sensitive to aggressive compression, with different methods showing performance drops of 17.4%-43.3%. Notably, the DeepSeek R1 Distill model exhibits more robust compression tolerance compared to instruction-tuned models, showing only 9.67%-25.53% performance degradation. Based on the analysis of attention patterns and cross-task compression performance, the study proposes ShotKV, a novel compression approach that distinctly handles prefill and decoding phases while maintaining shot-level semantic coherence. Empirical results show that ShotKV achieves 9%-18% performance improvements on long-context generation tasks under aggressive compression ratios. <br> <br>

23. ***Simple Embeddings Aid Data Curation:  <br>A study found basic token-averaged embeddings rivaled complex models for pretraining data selection. Authors urged embedding models tailored for pretraining similarity*** <br> <br>
    Feb 4, CMU and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02494) “Analyzing Similarity Metrics for Data Selection for Language Model Pretraining”. Similarity between training examples is used to curate pretraining datasets for language models by many methods -- for diversification and to select examples similar to high-quality data. However, similarity is typically measured with off-the-shelf embedding models that are generic or trained for tasks such as retrieval. This paper introduces a framework to analyze the suitability of embedding models specifically for data curation in the language model pretraining setting. The study quantifies the correlation between similarity in the embedding space to similarity in pretraining loss between different training examples, and how diversifying in the embedding space affects pretraining quality. The study analyzes a variety of embedding models in the framework, with experiments using the Pile dataset for pretraining a 1.7B parameter decoder-only language model. The study finds that the embedding models considered are all useful for pretraining data curation. Moreover, a simple approach of averaging per-token embeddings proves to be surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated embedding models -- likely because the latter are not designed specifically for pretraining data curation. Indeed, the authors believe the analysis and evaluation framework can serve as a foundation for the design of embedding models that specifically reason about similarity in pretraining datasets. <br> <br>

25. ***DeepSeek Challenges AI Cost Myths:  <br>IBM’s CEO highlighted DeepSeek’s $6M model (2,000 chips) as proof that small, open models can rival expensive systems. Argued for decentralized AI development*** <br> <br>
    Feb 4, Fortune published an [article](https://fortune.com/2025/02/04/ibm-ceo-ai-deepseek-technology/) by IBM CEO Arvind Krishna “DeepSeek proved us right—AI is not about big, proprietary systems”. DeepSeek has recently challenged the conventional wisdom in AI by demonstrating that training cutting-edge models does not require over $1 billion and thousands of the latest chips. They trained their latest model with just 2,000 Nvidia chips at a cost of around $6 million, proving that smaller, efficient models can deliver real results without massive, proprietary systems. This raises the question of who will shape the future of AI, emphasizing that AI development should not be controlled by a few players, especially those who may not share values like data protection, privacy, and transparency. Instead, AI should be built by a broad coalition of universities, companies, research labs, and civil society organizations to ensure true progress and innovation. The narrative that AI requires massive, expensive infrastructure is a false choice. The cost of training and inference is an engineering challenge that can be solved, making AI more practical and widespread. This is similar to the early days of computing when storage and processing power were prohibitively expensive but eventually became affordable through technological advancements and economies of scale. The same will happen with AI, making it transformative for businesses everywhere. By embracing open and efficient AI models, businesses can access cost-effective solutions tailored to their needs, unlocking AI's full potential across industries. <br> <br>

27. ***SmolLM2 Punches Above Its Weight:  <br>A 1.7B-parameter model trained on 11T tokens outperformed larger rivals. Released datasets included FineMath and Stack-Edu to advance small-LM research*** <br> <br>
    Feb 4, Huggingface published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02737v1) “SmolLM2: When Smol Goes Big — Data-Centric Training of a Small Language Model”. While large language models have facilitated breakthroughs in many applications of artificial intelligence, their inherent largeness makes them computationally expensive and challenging to deploy in resource-constrained settings. This study documents the development of SmolLM2, a state-of-the-art “small” (1.7 billion parameter) language model (LM). To attain strong performance, the study overtrains SmolLM2 on ~11 trillion tokens of data using a multi-stage training process that mixes web text with specialized math, code, and instruction-following data. The study additionally introduces new specialized datasets (FineMath, Stack-Edu, and SmolTalk) at stages where found existing datasets to be problematically small or low-quality. To inform the design decisions, the study performs both small-scale ablations as well as a manual refinement process that updates the dataset mixing rates at each stage based on the performance at the previous stage. Ultimately, the study demonstrates that SmolLM2 outperforms other recent small LMs including Qwen2.5-1.5B and Llama3.2-1B. To facilitate future research on LM development as well as applications of small LMs, the authors release both SmolLM2 as well as all of the datasets prepared in the course of this project. <br> <br>

29. ***AIM Merging Boosts LLM Performance:  <br>Activation-informed merging improved benchmark results by up to 40%, preserving critical weights via continual learning principles. Compatible with existing techniques*** <br> <br>
    Feb 4, MIT, Stony Brook Uni and IBM published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02421) “Activation-Informed Merging of Large Language Models”. Model merging, a method that combines the parameters and embeddings of multiple fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), offers a promising approach to enhance model performance across various tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. This paper introduces Activation-Informed Merging (AIM), a technique that integrates the information from the activation space of LLMs into the merging process to improve performance and robustness. AIM is designed as a flexible, complementary solution that is applicable to any existing merging method. It aims to preserve critical weights from the base model, drawing on principles from continual learning~(CL) and model compression. Utilizing a task-agnostic calibration set, AIM selectively prioritizes essential weights during merging. The study empirically demonstrates that AIM significantly enhances the performance of merged models across multiple benchmarks. The findings suggest that considering the activation-space information can provide substantial advancements in the model merging strategies for LLMs with up to 40\% increase in benchmark performance. <br> <br>

31. ***Evolving In-Context Learning Dynamics <br>
The paper investigates how attention-based models acquire in-context learning abilities during gradient descent training, focusing on multi-head linear self-attention for linear regression. It compares two parametrizations: one with merged key and query weights—which exhibits two fixed points and an abrupt loss drop with an analytical solution—and one with separate key and query matrices, where training involves exponentially many fixed points and saddle-to-saddle dynamics reducible to scalar ODEs. The analysis shows that during training, the model progressively implements principal component regression, revealing distinct dynamics of abrupt acquisition versus gradual improvement based on the parametrization.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 4, MIT published [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01618) “A Probabilistic Inference Approach to Inference-Time Scaling of LLMs using Particle-Based Monte Carlo Methods”. Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant performance gains via scaling up model sizes and/or data. However, recent evidence suggests diminishing returns from such approaches, motivating scaling the computation spent at inference time. Existing inference-time scaling methods, usually with reward models, cast the task as a search problem, which tends to be vulnerable to reward hacking as a consequence of approximation errors in reward models. This study instead casts inference-time scaling as a probabilistic inference task and leverage sampling-based techniques to explore the typical set of the state distribution of a state-space model with an approximate likelihood, rather than optimize for its mode directly. The study proposes a novel inference-time scaling approach by adapting particle-based Monte Carlo methods to this task. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that the methods have a 4-16x better scaling rate over the deterministic search counterparts on various challenging mathematical reasoning tasks. Using the approach, it shows that Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct can surpass GPT-4o accuracy in only 4 rollouts, while Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct scales to o1 level accuracy in only 32 rollouts. The work not only presents an effective method to inference-time scaling, but also connects the rich literature in probabilistic inference with inference-time scaling of LLMs to develop more robust algorithms in future work. Code and further information is available at https://probabilistic-inference-scaling.github.io. <br> <br>

33. ***Uncovering Optimal Sparsity in MoE Models <br>
This study explores the interplay between model capacity—defined by the number of parameters and FLOPs per example—in sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language models. By varying the sparsity level (the fraction of inactive parameters), the research finds that under different constraints (e.g., total training compute and parameter size), there is an optimal level of sparsity that enhances both training efficiency and downstream few-shot evaluation performance. These results provide critical insights into designing more efficient architectures by balancing capacity and computational cost.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 4, Ecole Polytechnique and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02671) “On Teacher Hacking in Language Model Distillation”. Post-training of language models (LMs) increasingly relies on the following two stages: (i) knowledge distillation, where the LM is trained to imitate a larger teacher LM, and (ii) reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where the LM is aligned by optimizing a reward model. In the second RLHF stage, a well-known challenge is reward hacking, where the LM over-optimizes the reward model. Such phenomenon is in line with Goodhart's law and can lead to degraded performance on the true objective. This study investigates whether a similar phenomenon, that is called teacher hacking, can occur during knowledge distillation. This could arise because the teacher LM is itself an imperfect approximation of the true distribution. To study this, the word proposes a controlled experimental setup involving: (i) an oracle LM representing the ground-truth distribution, (ii) a teacher LM distilled from the oracle, and (iii) a student LM distilled from the teacher. Experiments reveal the following insights. When using a fixed offline dataset for distillation, teacher hacking occurs; moreover, the study can detect it by observing when the optimization process deviates from polynomial convergence laws. In contrast, employing online data generation techniques effectively mitigates teacher hacking. More precisely, the authors identify data diversity as the key factor in preventing hacking. Overall, the findings provide a deeper understanding of the benefits and limitations of distillation for building robust and efficient LMs. <br> <br>

35. ***Dynamic Retrieval for Enhanced Generation <br>
The paper introduces Chain-of-Retrieval Augmented Generation (CoRAG), an approach that improves o1-like RAG models by dynamically refining queries and retrieval steps before generating the final answer. Instead of a single retrieval step, CoRAG uses rejection sampling to generate intermediate retrieval chains, then employs various decoding strategies to scale inference-time compute. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements—over 10 points in EM score on multi-hop question answering—and establish new state-of-the-art performance on the KILT benchmark, laying the groundwork for developing more factual and robust foundation models.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 3, OpenAI [release Deep Research](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/), An agent that uses reasoning to synthesize large amounts of online information and complete multi-step research tasks. Available to Pro users today, Plus and Team next. Deep research is OpenAI's next agent that can do work independently—give it a prompt, and ChatGPT will find, analyze, and synthesize hundreds of online sources to create a comprehensive report at the level of a research analyst. Powered by a version of the upcoming OpenAI o3 model that’s optimized for web browsing and data analysis, it leverages reasoning to search, interpret, and analyze massive amounts of text, images, and PDFs on the internet, pivoting as needed in reaction to information it encounters. The ability to synthesize knowledge is a prerequisite for creating new knowledge. For this reason, deep research marks a significant step toward a broader goal of developing AGI, which have long envisioned as capable of producing novel scientific research. Deep research was trained using end-to-end reinforcement learning on hard browsing and reasoning tasks across a range of domains. Through that training, it learned to plan and execute a multi-step trajectory to find the data it needs, backtracking and reacting to real-time information where necessary. The model is also able to browse over user uploaded files, plot and iterate on graphs using the python tool, embed both generated graphs and images from websites in its responses, and cite specific sentences or passages from its sources. As a result of this training, it reaches new highs on a number of public evaluations focused on real-world problems. <br> <br>

37. ***Prescriptive Neural Networks for Multimodal Data <br>
This study presents Prescriptive Neural Networks (PNNs), a novel multimodal deep learning framework that integrates optimization and machine learning to output prescriptions that optimize outcomes. Evaluated on real-world datasets, PNNs reduce postoperative complication rates in transcatheter aortic valve replacement by 32% and lower estimated mortality in liver trauma by over 40%. On unimodal tabular datasets, PNNs perform comparably to state-of-the-art models and recover interpretability via knowledge distillation, demonstrating stability and realistic prescription generation across different applications.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 3, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01591) “Improving Transformer World Models for Data-Efficient RL”. The work presents an approach to model-based RL that achieves a new state of the art performance on the challenging Craftax-classic benchmark, an open-world 2D survival game that requires agents to exhibit a wide range of general abilities -- such as strong generalization, deep exploration, and long-term reasoning. With a series of careful design choices aimed at improving sample efficiency, the MBRL algorithm achieves a reward of 67.4% after only 1M environment steps, significantly outperforming DreamerV3, which achieves 53.2%, and, for the first time, exceeds human performance of 65.0%. The method starts by constructing a SOTA model-free baseline, using a novel policy architecture that combines CNNs and RNNs. The study then adds three improvements to the standard MBRL setup: (a) "Dyna with warmup", which trains the policy on real and imaginary data, (b) "nearest neighbor tokenizer" on image patches, which improves the scheme to create the transformer world model (TWM) inputs, and (c) "block teacher forcing", which allows the TWM to reason jointly about the future tokens of the next timestep. <br> <br>

39. ***Emergent In-Context Reinforcement Learning <br>
The paper demonstrates that a pre-trained transformer, when fine-tuned with reinforcement learning over multiple episodes, develops an emergent ability known as In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL). This meta-learner not only excels in solving unseen in-distribution tasks with high sample efficiency but also performs strongly in out-of-distribution environments. Additionally, it shows robustness to the quality of training data, seamlessly integrating behaviors from its context and adapting to non-stationary environments, making it a powerful general-purpose problem solver.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 3, ABC published an [article](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-03/deepseek-accelerates-ai-robot-jobs-takeover/104886722) “DeepSeek's emergence signals the beginning of the human-replacing phase of AI”. The article discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI model, and its implications for the future of AI and employment. DeepSeek's release has intensified concerns about AI replacing human jobs, as it offers cost-effective and advanced reasoning capabilities. The article highlights the potential for widespread job redundancy and the need for universal income to address this issue. It also notes the significant investments in AI by major tech companies and the resulting market impacts, such as Nvidia's value fluctuations. The shift towards AI agents that can perform complex tasks autonomously is expected to further commoditize large language models (LLMs). The article suggests that AI's deflationary phase, characterized by reduced costs and increased efficiency, has begun, potentially leading to lower inflation and interest rates but also raising concerns about mass unemployment and the ethical implications of AI advancements. <br> <br>

41. ***racking Continuous Semantic Evolution <br>
The study proposes a simple yet effective framework to analyze semantic shifts over time by computing diachronic word similarity matrices using fast, lightweight word embeddings. This method allows for a deeper investigation of how word meanings and relationships change across arbitrary time periods. Moreover, by clustering these similarity matrices, the approach categorizes words that exhibit similar patterns of semantic shift in an unsupervised manner, offering a cost-effective tool for studying continuous language evolution.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 3, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01637) “Scaling Embedding Layers in Language Models”. The study proposes SCONE (Scalable, Contextualized, Offloaded, N-gram Embedding), a method for extending input embedding layers to enhance language model performance as layer size scales. To avoid increased decoding costs, SCONE retains the original vocabulary while introducing embeddings for a set of frequent n-grams. These embeddings provide contextualized representation for each input token and are learned with a separate model during training. During inference, they are precomputed and stored in off-accelerator memory with minimal impact on inference speed. SCONE enables two new scaling strategies: increasing the number of cached n-gram embeddings and scaling the model used to learn them, all while maintaining fixed inference-time FLOPS. The study shows that scaling both aspects allows SCONE to outperform a 1.9B parameter baseline across diverse corpora, while using only half the inference-time FLOPS. <br> <br>

45. ***Enhancing Confidence Estimation in LLMs <br>
This paper proposes a method for relative confidence estimation in language models by comparing responses against each other rather than providing absolute confidence scores. By treating each question as a player in a matchup and using rank aggregation methods like Elo rating and Bradley-Terry models, the approach yields more reliable confidence estimates than traditional absolute methods. Experimental evaluations across several state-of-the-art LMs show that relative confidence estimation improves selective classification performance and provides more nuanced uncertainty measures.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 3, Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01126) “Language Models Prefer What They Know: Relative Confidence Estimation via Confidence Preferences”. Language models (LMs) should provide reliable confidence estimates to help users detect mistakes in their outputs and defer to human experts when necessary. Asking a language model to assess its confidence ("Score your confidence from 0-1.") is a natural way of evaluating its uncertainty. However, models struggle to provide absolute assessments of confidence (i.e. judging confidence in answering a question independent of other questions) and the coarse-grained scores they produce are not useful for evaluating the correctness of their answers. The study proposes relative confidence estimation to match up questions against each other and ask the model to make relative judgments of confidence ("Which question are you more confident in answering correctly?"). Treating each question as a "player" in a series of matchups against other questions and the model's preferences as match outcomes, the study can use rank aggregation methods like Elo rating and Bradley-Terry to translate the model's confidence preferences into confidence scores. The study evaluates relative confidence estimation against absolute confidence estimation and self-consistency confidence methods on five state-of-the-art LMs -- GPT-4, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Llama 3.1 405B -- across 14 challenging STEM, social science, and commonsense reasoning question answering tasks. Results demonstrate that relative confidence estimation consistently provides more reliable confidence scores than absolute confidence estimation, with average gains of 3.5% in selective classification AUC over direct absolute confidence estimation methods and 1.7% over self-consistency approaches across all models and datasets. <br> <br>

47. ***Enabling Robust Long-Term Knowledge Editing <br>
The study addresses the challenge of sequential knowledge editing, which typically leads to model degradation due to overfitting and disproportionate norm growth in the edited layers. It reveals that "importance hacking"—where edited layers disproportionately influence outputs—is a key issue. To mitigate these effects, the authors propose ENCORE, which uses early stopping and norm constraints to enable up to 10,000 sequential edits without degrading downstream performance. ENCORE also achieves significant speed improvements compared to previous methods like MEMIT and AlphaEdit.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 3, UC Berkeley, SCB DataX and Uni of Virginia published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01636) “Lifelong Sequential Knowledge Editing without Model Degradation”. Prior work in parameter-modifying knowledge editing has shown that large-scale sequential editing leads to significant model degradation. This study explores the reasons behind this and scale sequential knowledge editing to 10,000 sequential edits, while maintaining the downstream performance of the original model. The work first shows that locate-then-edit knowledge editing methods lead to overfitting on the edited facts. The study also shows that continuous knowledge editing using these methods leads to disproportionate growth in the norm of the edited matrix. The work then provides a crucial insight into the inner workings of locate-then-edit methods. The study shows that norm-growth is a hidden trick employed by these methods that gives larger importance to the output activations produced from the edited layers. With this "importance hacking", the edited layers provide a much larger contributions to the model's output. To mitigate these issues, the study presents ENCORE - Early stopping and Norm-Constrained Robust knowledge Editing. ENCORE controls for overfitting and the disproportionate norm-growth to enable long-term sequential editing, able to perform up to 10,000 sequential edits without loss of downstream performance. ENCORE is also 61% faster than MEMIT and 64% faster than AlphaEdit on Llama3-8B. <br> <br>

49. ***Accelerating Long-Context Processing with FastKV <br>
FastKV is introduced as a novel method for compressing key-value (KV) caches in large language models to improve latency and throughput during long-context processing. The approach leverages Token-Selective Propagation (TSP) to retain full context in initial layers while selectively propagating information in deeper layers, combined with grouped-query attention-aware KV cache compression. Experimental results show that FastKV improves time-to-first-token by 2× and overall throughput by 1.4×, all while maintaining accuracy on long-context benchmarks.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 3, Seoul National Uni and Sunkyunkwan Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01068) “FastKV: KV Cache Compression for Fast Long-Context Processing with Token-Selective Propagation”. While large language models (LLMs) excel at handling long-context sequences, they require substantial key-value (KV) caches to store contextual information, which can heavily burden computational efficiency and memory usage. Previous efforts to compress these KV caches primarily focused on reducing memory demands but were limited in enhancing latency. To address this issue, we introduce FastKV, a KV cache compression method designed to enhance latency for long-context sequences. To enhance processing speeds while maintaining accuracy, FastKV adopts a novel Token-Selective Propagation (TSP) approach that retains the full context information in the initial layers of LLMs and selectively propagates only a portion of this information in deeper layers even in the prefill stage. Additionally, FastKV incorporates grouped-query attention (GQA)-aware KV cache compression to exploit the advantages of GQA in both memory and computational efficiency. Experimental results show that FastKV achieves 2.00times and 1.40times improvements in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and throughput, respectively, compared to HeadKV, the state-of-the-art KV cache compression method. Moreover, FastKV successfully maintains accuracy on long-context benchmarks at levels comparable to the baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/dongwonjo/FastKV. <br> <br>

51. ***Enhancing Vision-Text Alignment in Multimodal Models <br>
The paper presents AlignVLM, a novel method for bridging visual features and language embeddings by mapping visual inputs to a weighted average of LLM text embeddings. This approach leverages linguistic priors to ensure that the mapped visual features align well with the LLM’s latent space, leading to improved performance on document understanding tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance and robustness to noise compared to prior vision-text alignment methods.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 3, ServiceNow, York Uni, Mila et al. published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01341) “AlignVLM: Bridging Vision and Language Latent Spaces for Multimodal Understanding” . Aligning visual features with language embeddings is a key challenge in vision-language models (VLMs). The performance of such models hinges on having a good connector that maps visual features generated by a vision encoder to a shared embedding space with the LLM while preserving semantic similarity. Existing connectors, such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), often produce out-of-distribution or noisy inputs, leading to misalignment between the modalities. This study proposes a novel vision-text alignment method, AlignVLM, that maps visual features to a weighted average of LLM text embeddings. The approach leverages the linguistic priors encoded by the LLM to ensure that visual features are mapped to regions of the space that the LLM can effectively interpret. AlignVLM is particularly effective for document understanding tasks, where scanned document images must be accurately mapped to their textual content. Extensive experiments show that AlignVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to prior alignment methods. The study provides further analysis demonstrating improved vision-text feature alignment and robustness to noise. <br> <br>

53. ***Scaling Verification for Robust Inference-Time Search <br>
This study examines sampling-based search methods that generate multiple candidate responses and use self-verification to select the best one during inference. It finds that simply scaling the number of candidates improves verification accuracy—a phenomenon attributed to implicit scaling. The authors also highlight that comparing different output styles and responses provides useful signals for error detection, though current frontier models still exhibit weak out-of-box verification capabilities. A new benchmark is introduced to measure progress in enhancing self-verification.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 3, Google and UC Berkeley published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01839) “Sample, Scrutinize and Scale: Effective Inference-Time Search by Scaling Verification”. Sampling-based search, a simple paradigm for utilizing test-time compute, involves generating multiple candidate responses and selecting the best one -- typically by verifying each response for correctness. In this paper, the authors study the scaling trends governing sampling-based search. Among the findings is that simply scaling up a minimalist implementation that uses only random sampling and direct self-verification results in sustained performance improvements that, for example, elevate the Gemini v1.5 Pro model's reasoning capabilities past that of o1-Preview on popular benchmarks. The work partially attributes the scalability of sampling-based search to a phenomenon of implicit scaling, where sampling a larger pool of responses in turn improves verification accuracy. The study further identifies two useful principles for improving self-verification capabilities with test-time compute: (1) comparing across responses provides helpful signals about the locations of errors and hallucinations, and (2) different model output styles are useful for different contexts -- chains of thought are useful for reasoning but harder to verify. The study also finds that, though accurate verification can be elicited, frontier models demonstrate remarkably weak out-of-box verification capabilities and introduce a benchmark to measure progress on these deficiencies. <br> <br>

55. ***Training with Harmonic Loss for Better Interpretability <br>
The paper introduces harmonic loss as an alternative to cross-entropy loss for training neural networks and large language models. Harmonic loss is designed to be scale invariant and converge to a finite point, effectively creating interpretable class centers. Experiments across algorithmic, vision, and language tasks demonstrate that models trained with harmonic loss not only converge faster and require less data for generalization, but also develop more interpretable representations compared to models trained with standard loss functions.*** <br> <br>
    Feb 3, MIT published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01628) “Harmonic Loss Trains Interpretable AI Models”. This study introduces **harmonic loss** as an alternative to the standard cross-entropy loss for training neural networks and large language models (LLMs). Harmonic loss enables improved interpretability and faster convergence, owing to its scale invariance and finite convergence point by design, which can be interpreted as a class center. The study first validates the performance of harmonic models across algorithmic, vision, and language datasets. Through extensive experiments, the study demonstrates that models trained with harmonic loss outperform standard models by: (a) enhancing interpretability, (b) requiring less data for generalization, and (c) reducing grokking. Moreover, the study compares a GPT-2 model trained with harmonic loss to the standard GPT-2, illustrating that the harmonic model develops more interpretable representations. Looking forward, the authors believe harmonic loss has the potential to become a valuable tool in domains with limited data availability or in high-stakes applications where interpretability and reliability are paramount, paving the way for more robust and efficient neural network models. <br> <br>

57. ***Boosting Robustness with Increased Inference Compute <br>
This work explores how increasing inference-time compute in reasoning models (such as OpenAI’s o1-preview and o1-mini) enhances their robustness to adversarial attacks. The study shows that allowing models to spend more compute on reasoning can dramatically reduce the success rate of adversarial attacks, with many cases showing near-zero attack success. While some attack forms remain challenging, the findings suggest that scaling inference compute is a promising strategy for improving the adversarial robustness of large language models.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 31, OpenAI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18841) “Trading Inference-Time Compute for Adversarial Robustness”. The work conducts experiments on the impact of increasing inference-time compute in reasoning models (specifically OpenAI o1-preview and o1-mini) on their robustness to adversarial attacks. The study finds that across a variety of attacks, increased inference-time compute leads to improved robustness. In many cases (with important exceptions), the fraction of model samples where the attack succeeds tends to zero as the amount of test-time compute grows. The work performs no adversarial training for the tasks studied, and increases inference-time compute by simply allowing the models to spend more compute on reasoning, independently of the form of attack. The results suggest that inference-time compute has the potential to improve adversarial robustness for Large Language Models. The work also explores new attacks directed at reasoning models, as well as settings where inference-time compute does not improve reliability, and speculate on the reasons for these as well as ways to address them.

59. ***Decoding-Based Regression as a Flexible Alternative <br>
The study demonstrates that language models, despite being trained for next-token prediction with cross-entropy loss, can be effectively used for regression tasks by decoding numeric predictions as strings. This decoding-based regression approach performs comparably to traditional regression techniques on tabular data while offering flexibility in capturing arbitrary distributions, such as those required for density estimation. The work provides theoretical justification for this capability, highlighting its potential as a versatile alternative in regression tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 31, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.19383v1) “Decoding-based Regression”. Language models have recently been shown capable of performing regression tasks wherein numeric predictions are represented as decoded strings. In this work, the authors provide theoretical grounds for this capability and furthermore investigate the utility of causal auto-regressive sequence models when they are applied to any feature representation. The study finds that, despite being trained in the usual way - for next-token prediction via cross-entropy loss - decoding-based regression is as performant as traditional approaches for tabular regression tasks, while being flexible enough to capture arbitrary distributions, such as in the task of density estimation. <br> <br>

61. ***Self-Play Enhances Theorem Proving <br>
This study tackles the limited availability of high-quality training data for formal theorem proving by LLMs. It introduces a self-play framework where a single model alternates between generating challenging conjectures and proving them. By iteratively training the conjecturer on barely provable statements and refining the prover via expert iteration, the method doubles previous performance benchmarks on Lean and achieves state-of-the-art results on miniF2F, Proofnet, and PutnamBench.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 31, Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00212) “Beyond Limited Data: Self-play LLM Theorem Provers with Iterative Conjecturing and Proving”. A fundamental challenge in formal theorem proving by LLMs is the lack of high-quality training data. Although reinforcement learning or expert iteration partially mitigates this issue by alternating between LLM generating proofs and finetuning them on correctly generated ones, performance quickly plateaus due to the scarcity of correct proofs (sparse rewards). To keep improving the models with limited data, the study draws inspiration from mathematicians, who continuously develop new results, partly by proposing novel conjectures or exercises (which are often variants of known results) and attempting to solve them. The study designs the Self-play Theorem Prover (STP) that simultaneously takes on two roles, conjecturer and prover, each providing training signals to the other. The conjecturer is trained iteratively on previously generated conjectures that are barely provable by the current prover, which incentivizes it to generate increasingly challenging conjectures over time. The prover attempts to prove the conjectures with standard expert iteration. The study evaluates STP with both Lean and Isabelle formal versifiers. With 19.8 billion tokens generated during the training in Lean, STP proves 26.3% of the statements in the LeanWorkbook dataset, doubling the previous best result of 13.2% achieved through expert iteration. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance among whole-proof generation methods on miniF2F-test (61.1%, pass@3200), Proofnet-test (23.1%, pass@3200) and PutnamBench (8/644, pass@64). <br> <br>

63. ***Simple Test-Time Scaling Boosts Reasoning <br>
The research proposes a straightforward method for improving language model reasoning by scaling test-time compute. Using a curated dataset and a technique called budget forcing, the model is prompted to either terminate or extend its reasoning process, effectively double-checking its answers. After finetuning, the approach significantly outperforms previous models on challenging math tasks, with performance gains that further increase as test-time compute scales.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 31, Stanford Uni, Uni of Washington and Allen Inst for AI published a [paper](s1: Simple test-time scaling) “s1: Simple test-time scaling”. Test-time scaling is a promising new approach to language modeling that uses extra test-time compute to improve performance. Recently, OpenAI's o1 model showed this capability but did not publicly share its methodology, leading to many replication efforts. The study seeks the simplest approach to achieve test-time scaling and strong reasoning performance. First, the study curates a small dataset s1K of 1,000 questions paired with reasoning traces relying on three criteria validated through ablations: difficulty, diversity, and quality. Second, the work develops budget forcing to control test-time compute by forcefully terminating the model's thinking process or lengthening it by appending "Wait" multiple times to the model's generation when it tries to end. This can lead the model to double-check its answer, often fixing incorrect reasoning steps. After supervised finetuning the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct language model on s1K and equipping it with budget forcing, the model s1 exceeds o1-preview on competition math questions by up to 27% (MATH and AIME24). Further, scaling s1 with budget forcing allows extrapolating beyond its performance without test-time intervention: from 50% to 57% on AIME24. The model, data, and code are open-source at https://github.com/simplescaling/s1. <br> <br>

65. ***Unified Framework for Model Alignment <br>
The paper introduces Reward-Aware Preference Optimization (RPO), a unified mathematical framework that brings together various preference optimization techniques used in LLM alignment. By disentangling design choices such as the optimization objective and the use of implicit versus explicit rewards, and through extensive ablation studies, RPO provides clear guidance on effective strategies to improve LLM alignment, bridging methods like DPO, IPO, SimPO, and REINFORCE.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 31, Nvidia published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00203) “Reward-aware Preference Optimization: A Unified Mathematical Framework for Model Alignment”. The rapid development of large language model (LLM) alignment algorithms has resulted in a complex and fragmented landscape, with limited clarity on the effectiveness of different methods and their inter-connections. This paper introduces Reward-Aware Preference Optimization (RPO), a mathematical framework that unifies popular preference optimization techniques in LLM alignment, including DPO, IPO, SimPO, and REINFORCE (LOO), among others. RPO provides a structured approach to disentangle and systematically study the impact of various design choices, such as the optimization objective, the number of responses per prompt, and the use of implicit versus explicit reward models, on LLM preference optimization. The study additionally proposes a new experimental setup that enables the clean and direct ablation of such design choices. Through an extensive series of ablation studies within the RPO framework, the study gains insights into the critical factors shaping model alignment, offering practical guidance on the most effective strategies for improving LLM alignment. <br> <br>

67. ***Speculative Decoding Optimizes Inference Efficiency <br>
This work presents Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding (RSD), a framework that combines a lightweight draft model with a more powerful target model to enhance inference efficiency. By using a process reward model to evaluate intermediate decoding steps and a threshold-based mixture strategy, RSD achieves substantial efficiency gains—up to 4.4× fewer FLOPs—while also improving accuracy on challenging reasoning benchmarks, particularly in complex tasks such as Olympiad-level questions.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 31, Uni of Amsterdam and Salesforce published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.19324) “Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding for Efficient LLM Reasoning”. The study introduces Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding (RSD), a novel framework aimed at improving the efficiency of inference in large language models (LLMs). RSD synergistically combines a lightweight draft model with a more powerful target model, incorporating a controlled bias to prioritize high-reward outputs, in contrast to existing speculative decoding methods that enforce strict unbiasedness. RSD employs a process reward model to evaluate intermediate decoding steps and dynamically decide whether to invoke the target model, optimizing the trade-off between computational cost and output quality. The study theoretically demonstrates that a threshold-based mixture strategy achieves an optimal balance between resource utilization and performance. Extensive evaluations on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including Olympiad-level tasks, show that RSD delivers significant efficiency gains against decoding with the target model only (up to 4.4x fewer FLOPs), while achieving significant better accuracy than parallel decoding method on average (up to +3.5). These results highlight RSD as a robust and cost-effective approach for deploying LLMs in resource-intensive scenarios. <br> <br>

69. ***Optimization Theory Meets Learning-Rate Scheduling <br>
The study reveals a surprising alignment between learning-rate schedules used in training large models and performance bounds from non-smooth convex optimization theory. By deriving a bound for a constant schedule with linear cooldown, the research demonstrates that the practical benefits of cooldown are theoretically justified. These insights enable improved learning-rate tuning, leading to noticeable performance gains when training Llama-type models.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 31, PSL Research Uni and EPFL published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18965) “The Surprising Agreement Between Convex Optimization Theory and Learning-Rate Scheduling for Large Model Training”. The study shows that learning-rate schedules for large model training behave surprisingly similar to a performance bound from non-smooth convex optimization theory. The work provides a bound for the constant schedule with linear cooldown; in particular, the practical benefit of cooldown is reflected in the bound due to the absence of logarithmic terms. Further, the study shows that this surprisingly close match between optimization theory and practice can be exploited for learning-rate tuning: the work achieves noticeable improvements for training 124M and 210M Llama-type models by (i) extending the schedule for continued training with optimal learning-rate, and (ii) transferring the optimal learning-rate across schedules. <br> <br>

71. ***DeepSeek Exemplifies China's AI Innovation <br>
This article details how China's AI start-up DeepSeek achieved remarkable success with its cost-effective LLMs, DeepSeek-R1 and Janus-Pro-7B, which rival US models at a fraction of the cost. Supported by substantial government funding, strong AI talent, and innovative architectures like mixture-of-experts and multi-head latent attention, DeepSeek’s approach is seen as a potential blueprint for efficient AI development globally, even amid export control challenges.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 30, Nature published an [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00259-0) “How China created AI model DeepSeek and shocked the world”. DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, has made significant strides in the AI field with the release of two advanced large language models (LLMs), DeepSeek-R1 and Janus-Pro-7B, which rival the performance of US-developed models but at a fraction of the cost. This success is attributed to China's government policies, substantial funding, and a strong pipeline of AI graduates. The Chinese government has prioritized AI development, aiming to become a global leader by 2030, and has invested heavily in AI education and talent development. DeepSeek's innovative approach, including the use of a 'mixture-of-experts' architecture and multi-head latent attention, has allowed it to develop efficient models despite US export controls on advanced AI chips. The company's achievements highlight China's growing capabilities in AI and suggest a shift towards more cost-effective and efficient AI development methods. This could serve as a blueprint for other countries with AI ambitions but limited resources. Despite some controversies, such as allegations of using outputs from OpenAI models, DeepSeek's advancements are seen as a significant milestone in the AI industry. <br> <br>

73. ***DeepSeek Champions Transparent, Ethical AI <br>
Focusing on explainability and ethics, DeepSeek-R1 is highlighted as a model that not only delivers efficiency but also makes its reasoning process explicit. This transparency enhances trust and accountability, particularly in high-stakes fields such as healthcare and law. Despite challenges like overfitting and data privacy concerns, DeepSeek-R1’s open-source and ethical approach sets a compelling vision for responsible AI governance.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 30, Forbes published an [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/geruiwang/2025/01/30/deepseek-redefines-ai-with-explainable-reasoning-and-open-innovation/) “DeepSeek Has More To Offer Beyond Efficiency: Explainable AI”. DeepSeek-R1 is revolutionizing the AI landscape with its emphasis on transparency, ethics, and open-source collaboration. Unlike other AI models that operate as "black boxes," DeepSeek-R1 explicitly outlines its reasoning process, enhancing trust and accuracy. It integrates ethics into every response, proactively addressing potential biases and risks, which is crucial for high-stakes fields like healthcare and law. DeepSeek-R1's commitment to open-source development and solving foundational AI challenges sets it apart from profit-driven models. This approach not only democratizes access to advanced AI but also accelerates innovation in critical areas like climate modeling and pandemic prediction. Despite its impressive capabilities, DeepSeek-R1 faces challenges such as overfitting and data privacy concerns, which require robust safeguards. Overall, DeepSeek-R1 offers a compelling vision for AI's future, balancing power with transparency and ethics, and providing a template for responsible AI governance. <br> <br>

75. ***LLM-AutoDiff Revolutionizes Prompt Engineering <br>
LLM-AutoDiff is introduced as a novel framework for automatic prompt optimization in complex LLM workflows. By treating textual inputs as trainable parameters and applying textual gradient methods across multi-component and potentially cyclic architectures, it enables efficient and accurate prompt updates. The framework significantly outperforms existing methods in accuracy and training cost, offering a powerful, graph-centric paradigm for automating and scaling LLM workflows.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 30, SylphAI and Uni of Texas at Austin published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16673) “LLM-AutoDiff: Auto-Differentiate Any LLM Workflow”. Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped natural language processing, powering applications from multi-hop retrieval and question answering to autonomous agent workflows. Yet, prompt engineering -- the task of crafting textual inputs to effectively direct LLMs -- remains difficult and labor-intensive, particularly for complex pipelines that combine multiple LLM calls with functional operations like retrieval and data formatting. The study introduces LLM-AutoDiff: a novel framework for Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) that extends textual gradient-based methods (such as Text-Grad) to multi-component, potentially cyclic LLM architectures. Implemented within the AdalFlow library, LLM-AutoDiff treats each textual input as a trainable parameter and uses a frozen backward engine LLM to generate feedback-akin to textual gradients -- that guide iterative prompt updates. Unlike prior single-node approaches, LLM-AutoDiff inherently accommodates functional nodes, preserves time-sequential behavior in repeated calls (e.g., multi-hop loops), and combats the "lost-in-the-middle" problem by isolating distinct sub-prompts (instructions, formats, or few-shot examples). It further boosts training efficiency by focusing on error-prone samples through selective gradient computation. Across diverse tasks, including single-step classification, multi-hop retrieval-based QA, and agent-driven pipelines, LLM-AutoDiff consistently outperforms existing textual gradient baselines in both accuracy and training cost. By unifying prompt optimization through a graph-centric lens, LLM-AutoDiff offers a powerful new paradigm for scaling and automating LLM workflows - mirroring the transformative role that automatic differentiation libraries have long played in neural network research.

1. ***Meta’s Adaptive Reasoning with IBPO </b>Meta and UIUC propose Inference Budget-Constrained Policy Optimization (IBPO) to improve LLM reasoning efficiency by allocating inference budgets based on query difficulty. IBPO yields significant accuracy improvements on MATH500 with lower computational costs compared to traditional long chain-of-thought methods.*** <br> <br>
   Jan 31, Meta and UIUC published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17974) “Think Smarter not Harder: Adaptive Reasoning with Inference Aware Optimization”. Solving mathematics problems has been an intriguing capability of large language models, and many efforts have been made to improve reasoning by extending reasoning length, such as through self-correction and extensive long chain-of-thoughts. While promising in problem-solving, advanced long reasoning chain models exhibit an undesired single-modal behavior, where trivial questions require unnecessarily tedious long chains of thought. This study proposes a way to allow models to be aware of inference budgets by formulating it as utility maximization with respect to an inference budget constraint, hence naming the algorithm Inference Budget-Constrained Policy Optimization (IBPO). In a nutshell, models fine-tuned through IBPO learn to “understand” the difficulty of queries and allocate inference budgets to harder ones. With different inference budgets, the best models are able to have a 4.14\% and 5.74\% absolute improvement (8.08\% and 11.2\% relative improvement) on MATH500 using 2.16x and 4.32x inference budgets respectively, relative to LLaMA3.1 8B Instruct. These improvements are approximately 2x those of self-consistency under the same budgets. <br> <br>

3. ***OpenAI’s o3-mini Model  <br>OpenAI releases o3-mini, a fast and cost-effective reasoning model optimized for STEM tasks, integrated into ChatGPT. It outperforms previous models, achieves PhD-level science question accuracy, and is 93% cheaper than o1 while excelling in SQL and reasoning tasks.*** <br> <br>
   Jan 31, OpenAI [released o3-mini](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/). OpenAI's o3-mini, a new reasoning model, is now available in ChatGPT for free users via the "Reason" button, and through the API for paid users, with Pro users getting unlimited access to the "o3-mini-high" version. It is described as being fast, powerful, and optimized for STEM reasoning, particularly strong in science, math, and coding, with the claim that it outperforms the earlier o1 model on many STEM evaluations, and reached PhD-level science questions. The model uses search to find up-to-date answers with links to relevant web sources, and was evaluated for safety using the same methods as o1, significantly surpassing GPT-4o in challenging safety and jailbreak evals. The model is also much cheaper, costing 93% less than o1 per token, with input costs of $1.10/M tokens and output costs of $4.40/M tokens (with a 50% discount for cached tokens). It reportedly outperforms o1 in coding and other reasoning tasks at lower latency and cost, particularly on medium and high reasoning efforts, and performs exceptionally well on SQL evaluations.  <br> <br>

4. ***The commoditization of large language models (LLMs)  <br>
   The article discusses how the emergence of DeepSeek-R1 and next-generation AI agents could commoditize large language models (LLMs) like those from OpenAI. DeepSeek-R1, a cost-effective reasoning model, has caused significant market reactions, including a drop in Nvidia's market value. Executives predict a shift towards "agentic" systems that perform tasks autonomously, integrating LLM technology with business data. This trend suggests LLMs will become more integrated into intelligent systems, making AI more efficient and accessible, potentially leading to the commoditization of AI technology.*** <br> <br>
   Jan 31, CNBC published an article related to AI on DAVOS WEF 2025. “How DeepSeek and next-generation AI agents could erode value of language models” The article discusses the potential commoditization of large language models (LLMs) like those from OpenAI and other tech giants, as next-generation AI agents and open-source models like DeepSeek-R1 emerge. DeepSeek-R1, a new reasoning model from Chinese AI firm DeepSeek, claims to outperform OpenAI's o1 model in cost and performance. This shift has led to significant market reactions, including a massive drop in Nvidia's market capitalization. Executives predict that AI will move from LLMs to "agentic" systems that can perform tasks autonomously, integrating LLM technology with contextual business data. These AI agents are expected to transform interactions with technology by automating complex tasks, such as booking appointments. The trend towards open-source models and agentic systems suggests that LLMs will become more integrated into intelligent systems, making AI more efficient and accessible. This shift is seen as a move from focusing on the models themselves to how they can be used effectively within systems, potentially leading to a commoditization of AI technology. <br> <br>

6. ***Meta’s EvalPlanner for LLM-as-a-Judge  <br>Meta introduces EvalPlanner, a new approach for LLM evaluation that generates unconstrained evaluation plans before execution. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance on RewardBench and other benchmarks, improving LLM judgment quality.*** <br> <br>
   Jan 30, Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18099) “Learning to Plan & Reason for Evaluation with Thinking-LLM-as-a-Judge”. LLM-as-a-Judge models generate chain-of-thought (CoT) sequences intended to capture the step-bystep reasoning process that underlies the final evaluation of a response. However, due to the lack of human annotated CoTs for evaluation, the required components and structure of effective reasoning traces remain understudied. Consequently, previous approaches often (1) constrain reasoning traces to hand-designed components, such as a list of criteria, reference answers, or verification questions and (2) structure them such that planning is intertwined with the reasoning for evaluation. This study proposes EvalPlanner, a preference optimization algorithm for Thinking-LLM-as-a-Judge that first generates an unconstrained evaluation plan, followed by its execution, and then the final judgment. In a self-training loop, EvalPlanner iteratively optimizes over synthetically constructed evaluation plans and executions, leading to better final verdicts. The method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance for generative reward models on RewardBench (with a score of 93.9), despite being trained on fewer amount of, and synthetically generated, preference pairs. Additional experiments on other benchmarks like RM-Bench, JudgeBench, and FollowBenchEval further highlight the utility of both planning and reasoning for building robust LLM-as-a-Judge reasoning models. <br> <br>

7. ***Mistral Small 3: A Latency-Optimized Model  <br>Mistral releases a 24B-parameter open-source model that competes with larger models like Llama 3.3 70B while being 3x faster. It is highly efficient, ideal for local deployment, and achieves strong performance without RL or synthetic training data.*** <br> <br>
   Jan 30, Mistral [released Mistral Small 3](https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-small-3/), a latency-optimized 24B-parameter model released under the Apache 2.0 license. Mistral Small 3 is competitive with larger models such as Llama 3.3 70B or Qwen 32B, and is an excellent open replacement for opaque proprietary models like GPT4o-mini. Mistral Small 3 is on par with Llama 3.3 70B instruct, while being more than 3x faster on the same hardware. Mistral Small 3 is a pre-trained and instructed model catered to the ‘80%’ of generative AI tasks—those that require robust language and instruction following performance, with very low latency. The Mistral team designed this new model to saturate performance at a size suitable for local deployment. Particularly, Mistral Small 3 has far fewer layers than competing models, substantially reducing the time per forward pass. At over 81% accuracy on MMLU and 150 tokens/s latency, Mistral Small is currently the most efficient model of its category. The team is releasing both a pretrained and instruction-tuned checkpoint under Apache 2.0. The checkpoints can serve as a powerful base for accelerating progress. Note that Mistral Small 3 is neither trained with RL nor synthetic data, so is earlier in the model production pipeline than models like Deepseek R1 (a great and complementary piece of open-source technology!). It can serve as a great base model for building accrued reasoning capacities. The team is looking forward to seeing how the open-source community adopts and customizes it. <br> <br>

9. ***Google’s Improved DiLoCo for Distributed Training  <br>Google enhances distributed LLM training with an optimized version of DiLoCo that reduces bandwidth needs by synchronizing parameters sequentially, allowing ongoing training during synchronization, and using data quantization. This lowers communication costs by two orders of magnitude.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 30, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18512) “Streaming DiLoCo with overlapping communication: Towards a Distributed Free Lunch”. Training of large language models (LLMs) is typically distributed across a large number of accelerators to reduce training time. Since internal states and parameter gradients need to be exchanged at each and every single gradient step, all devices need to be co-located using low-latency high-bandwidth communication links to support the required high volume of exchanged bits. Recently, distributed algorithms like DiLoCo have relaxed such co-location constraint: accelerators can be grouped into “workers”, where synchronizations between workers only occur infrequently. This in turn means that workers can afford being connected by lower bandwidth communication links without affecting learning quality. However, in these methods, communication across workers still requires the same peak bandwidth as before, as the synchronizations require all parameters to be exchanged across all workers. This study improves DiLoCo in three ways. First, synchronize only subsets of parameters in sequence, rather than all at once, which greatly reduces peak bandwidth. Second, allow workers to continue training while synchronizing, which decreases wall clock time. Third, quantize the data exchanged by workers, which further reduces bandwidth across workers. By properly combining these modifications, the study shows experimentally that the study can distribute training of billion-scale parameters and reach similar quality as before, but reducing required bandwidth by two orders of magnitude. <br> <br>

11. ***Meta’s MILS: Training-Free Multimodal Reasoning  <br>Meta presents MILS, a method enabling LLMs to perform multimodal tasks (image, video, and audio captioning) without additional training. MILS also enhances text-to-image generation and enables cross-modal reasoning.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 30, Meta, UT Austin and UC Berkeley published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18096) “LLMs can see and hear without any training”. The study presents MILS: Multimodal Iterative LLM Solver, a surprisingly simple, training-free approach, to imbue multimodal capabilities into your favorite LLM. Leveraging their innate ability to perform multi-step reasoning, MILS prompts the LLM to generate candidate outputs, each of which are scored and fed back iteratively, eventually generating a solution to the task. This enables various applications that typically require training specialized models on task-specific data. In particular, the work establishes a new state-of-the-art on emergent zero-shot image, video and audio captioning. MILS seamlessly applies to media generation as well, discovering prompt rewrites to improve text-to-image generation, and even edit prompts for style transfer! Finally, being a gradient-free optimization approach, MILS can invert multimodal embeddings into text, enabling applications like cross-modal arithmetic. <br> <br>

13. ***Meta’s RIP: Data Quality Filtering for LLMs  <br>Meta, NYU, and UC Berkeley introduce Rejecting Instruction Preferences (RIP), a method to filter low-quality training data. RIP significantly improves performance on various benchmarks, leading to better instruction-following capabilities.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 30, Meta, NYU and UC Berkeley published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18578) “R.I.P.: Better Models by Survival of the Fittest Prompts”. Training data quality is one of the most important drivers of final model quality. This work introduces a method for evaluating data integrity based on the assumption that low-quality input prompts result in high variance and low quality responses. This is achieved by measuring the rejected response quality and the reward gap between the chosen and rejected preference pair. The method, Rejecting Instruction Preferences (RIP) can be used to filter prompts from existing training sets, or to make high quality synthetic datasets, yielding large performance gains across various benchmarks compared to unfiltered data. Using Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct, RIP improves AlpacaEval2 LC Win Rate by 9.4%, Arena-Hard by 8.7%, and WildBench by 9.9%. Using Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct, RIP improves Arena-Hard from 67.5 to 82.9, which is from 18th place to 6th overall in the leaderboard. <br> <br>

15. ***Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT) for LLMs  <br>Researchers propose Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT), where models learn by critiquing noisy responses rather than mimicking correct ones. CFT leads to a 4-10% improvement on math benchmarks, outperforming traditional fine-tuning methods.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 29, Uni of Waterloo, CMU, and Vector Inst published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17703) “Critique Fine-Tuning: Learning to Critique is More Effective than Learning to Imitate”. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is commonly used to train language models to imitate annotated responses for given instructions. This study challenges this paradigm and propose Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT), a strategy where models learn to critique noisy responses rather than simply imitate correct ones. Inspired by human learning processes that emphasize critical thinking, CFT encourages deeper analysis and nuanced understanding-traits often overlooked by standard SFT. To validate the effectiveness of CFT, the study constructs a 50K-sample dataset from WebInstruct, using GPT-4o as the teacher to generate critiques in the form of (input=[query; noisy response], output=critique). CFT on this dataset yields a consistent 4-10% improvement over SFT on six math benchmarks with different base models like Qwen2.5, Qwen2.5-Math and DeepSeek-Math. We further expand to MetaMath and NuminaMath datasets and observe similar gains over SFT. Notably, the Qwen2.5-Math-CFT model-trained on just 50K samples-matches or outperforms competitive models such as AceMath and Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct on most benchmarks, both of which use over 2M samples. Ablation studies show that CFT is robust to the source of noisy response and teacher critique model. Through these findings, the study argues that critique-based training offers a more effective alternative to advance the reasoning of language models. <br> <br>

17. ***UK Government’s International AI Safety Report  <br>The UK releases a comprehensive report on AI safety, addressing the capabilities, risks, and mitigation strategies for general-purpose AI. The report synthesizes expert insights from 30 nations, the UN, and academic institutions.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 29, the UK government released an independent [report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-ai-safety-report-2025) “International AI Safety Report 2025”. This first International AI Safety Report comprehensively synthesizes the current evidence on the capabilities, risks, and safety of advanced AI systems. The report was mandated by the nations attending the AI Safety Summit in Bletchley, UK. Thirty nations, the UN, the OECD, and the EU each nominated a representative to the report's Expert Advisory Panel. A total of 100 AI experts contributed, representing diverse perspectives and disciplines. Led by the report's Chair, these independent experts collectively had full discretion over the report's content. This report summarises the scientific evidence on the safety of general-purpose AI. Amid rapid advancements, research on general-purpose AI is currently in a time of scientific discovery, and – in many cases – is not yet settled science. People around the world will only be able to fully enjoy the potential benefits of general-purpose AI safely if its risks are appropriately managed. The three main sections of the report summarise the scientific evidence on three core questions: What can general-purpose AI do? What are risks associated with general-purpose AI? And what mitigation techniques are there against these risks? <br> <br>

19. ***Microsoft’s Hegelian Dialectic for Self-Reflecting LLMs  <br>Microsoft explores a Hegelian dialectical approach for LLM self-reflection, using internal critiques to generate new ideas. The method also introduces dynamic annealing and multi-agent validation to enhance creative reasoning.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 28, Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14917) “Self-reflecting Large Language Models: A Hegelian Dialectical Approach”. Investigating NLP through a philosophical lens has recently caught researcher's eyes as it connects computational methods with classical schools of philosophy. This paper introduces a philosophical approach inspired by the Hegelian Dialectic for LLMs' self-reflection, utilizing a self-dialectical approach to emulate internal critiques and then synthesize new ideas by resolving the contradicting points. Moreover, this paper investigates the effect of LLMs' temperature for generation by establishing a dynamic annealing approach, which promotes the creativity in the early stages and gradually refines it by focusing on the nuances, as well as a fixed temperature strategy for generation. The proposed approach is examined to determine its ability to generate novel ideas from an initial proposition. Additionally, a Multi Agent Majority Voting (MAMV) strategy is leveraged to assess the validity and novelty of the generated ideas, which proves beneficial in the absence of domain experts. Experiments show promise in generating new ideas and provide a stepping-stone for future research. <br> <br>

21. ***SFT vs. RL: A Generalization Study  <br>A comparative study of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) finds that RL improves generalization across text and vision tasks, while SFT is better suited for stabilizing model outputs before RL training.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 28, HKU, UC Berkley Google and NYU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17161) “SFT Memorizes, RL Generalizes: A Comparative Study of Foundation Model Post-training”. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used post-training techniques for foundation models. However, their roles in enhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies the difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing on text-based rule variants and visual variants. The study introduces GeneralPoints, an arithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation environment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen variants in both textual and visual domains. The study shows that RL, especially when trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based textual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data and struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis reveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition capabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain. Despite RL's superior generalization, the study shows that SFT remains essential for effective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling subsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrates the capability of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multi-modal tasks. <br> <br>

23. ***Microsoft’s FP4 Quantization for Efficient LLM Training  <br>Microsoft introduces an FP4 training framework to reduce LLM training costs while maintaining accuracy. Using novel quantization techniques, FP4 training achieves performance close to FP8/BF16 with significantly lower computational requirements.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 28, Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17116) “Optimizing Large Language Model Training Using FP4 Quantization”. The growing computational demands of training large language models (LLMs) necessitate more efficient methods. Quantized training presents a promising solution by enabling low-bit arithmetic operations to reduce these costs. While FP8 precision has demonstrated feasibility, leveraging FP4 remains a challenge due to significant quantization errors and limited representational capacity. This work introduces the first FP4 training framework for LLMs, addressing these challenges with two key innovations: a differentiable quantization estimator for precise weight updates and an outlier clamping and compensation strategy to prevent activation collapse. To ensure stability, the framework integrates a mixed-precision training scheme and vector-wise quantization. Experimental results demonstrate that the FP4 framework achieves accuracy comparable to BF16 and FP8, with minimal degradation, scaling effectively to 13B-parameter LLMs trained on up to 100B tokens. With the emergence of next-generation hardware supporting FP4, the framework sets a foundation for efficient ultra-low precision training. <br> <br>

25. ***CowPilot: Human-Agent Collaboration for Web Navigation  <br>CMU develops CowPilot, a framework that improves web navigation by allowing human-agent collaboration. Users can intervene or override agent decisions, leading to a 95% task success rate while reducing human effort.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 28, CMU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16609) “CowPilot: A Framework for Autonomous and Human-Agent Collaborative Web Navigation”. While much work on web agents emphasizes the promise of autonomously performing tasks on behalf of users, in reality, agents often fall short on complex tasks in real-world contexts and modeling user preference. This presents an opportunity for humans to collaborate with the agent and leverage the agent's capabilities effectively. The study proposes CowPilot, a framework supporting autonomous as well as human-agent collaborative web navigation, and evaluation across task success and task efficiency. CowPilot reduces the number of steps humans need to perform by allowing agents to propose next steps, while users are able to pause, reject, or take alternative actions. During execution, users can interleave their actions with the agent by overriding suggestions or resuming agent control when needed. The study conducted case studies on five common websites and found that the human-agent collaborative mode achieves the highest success rate of 95% while requiring humans to perform only 15.2% of the total steps. Even with human interventions during task execution, the agent successfully drives up to half of task success on its own. CowPilot can serve as a useful tool for data collection and agent evaluation across websites, which is believed will enable research in how users and agents can work together. Video demonstrations are available at https://oaishi.github.io/cowpilot.html <br> <br>

27. ***Meta’s Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (MR.Q)  <br>Meta proposes MR.Q, a reinforcement learning approach that balances model-based advantages with model-free simplicity. MR.Q achieves competitive performance across RL benchmarks without reliance on domain-specific tuning.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 27, Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16142) “Towards General-Purpose Model-Free Reinforcement Learning”. Reinforcement learning (RL) promises a framework for near-universal problem-solving. In practice however, RL algorithms are often tailored to specific benchmarks, relying on carefully tuned hyperparameters and algorithmic choices. Recently, powerful model-based RL methods have shown impressive general results across benchmarks but come at the cost of increased complexity and slow run times, limiting their broader applicability. This study attempts to find a unifying model-free deep RL algorithm that can address a diverse class of domains and problem settings. To achieve this, the study leverages model-based representations that approximately linearize the value function, taking advantage of the denser task objectives used by model-based RL while avoiding the costs associated with planning or simulated trajectories. The study evaluates the algorithm, MR.Q, on a variety of common RL benchmarks with a single set of hyperparameters and show a competitive performance against domain-specific and general baselines, providing a concrete step towards building general-purpose model-free deep RL algorithms. <br> <br>

29. ***Microsoft’s Encoder-Decoder Models for Small Language Models (SLMs)  <br>Microsoft re-evaluates encoder-decoder architectures for small language models, demonstrating superior efficiency over decoder-only models. The study introduces knowledge distillation techniques that improve performance while maintaining architectural efficiency.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 27, Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16273) “Return of the Encoder: Maximizing Parameter Efficiency for SLMs”. The dominance of large decoder-only language models has overshadowed encoder-decoder architectures, despite their fundamental efficiency advantages in sequence processing. For small language models (SLMs) - those with 1 billion parameters or fewer - the systematic analysis across GPU, CPU, and NPU platforms reveals that encoder-decoder architectures achieve 47% lower first-token latency and 4.7x higher throughput compared to decoder-only models on edge devices. These gains may be attributed to encoder-decoder's one-time input processing and efficient separation of understanding and generation phases. The study introduces a novel knowledge distillation framework that enables encoder-decoder models to leverage capabilities from large scalable decoder-only teachers while preserving their architectural advantages, achieving up to 6 average performance points improvement across diverse tasks, with significant gains in asymmetric sequence tasks where input and output distributions can benefit from different processing approaches. When combined with modern advances like Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) and Vision encoders, our systematic investigation demonstrates that encoder-decoder architectures provide a more practical path toward deploying capable language models in resource-constrained environments. Our findings challenge the prevailing trend toward decoder-only scaling, showing that architectural choices become increasingly crucial as parameter budgets decrease, particularly for on-device and edge deployments where computational efficiency is paramount. <br> <br>

31. ***Training Dynamics of In-Context Learning in Linear Attention <br>
The University College London study analyzes how linear self-attention models develop in-context learning abilities via gradient descent. For merged key-query parametrization, training shows two fixed points and a sudden loss drop, while separate parametrization exhibits saddle-to-saddle dynamics and principal component regression. The work contrasts abrupt vs. progressive learning patterns across parametrizations.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 27, Uni of College London published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16265) “Training Dynamics of In-Context Learning in Linear Attention”. While attention-based models have demonstrated the remarkable ability of in-context learning, the theoretical understanding of how these models acquired this ability through gradient descent training is still preliminary. Towards answering this question, the authors study the gradient descent dynamics of multi-head linear self-attention trained for in-context linear regression. The study examines two parametrizations of linear self-attention: one with the key and query weights merged as a single matrix (common in theoretical studies), and one with separate key and query matrices (closer to practical settings). For the merged parametrization, the study shows the training dynamics has two fixed points and the loss trajectory exhibits a single, abrupt drop. The study derives an analytical time-course solution for a certain class of datasets and initialization. For the separate parametrization, the work shows the training dynamics has exponentially many fixed points and the loss exhibits saddle-to-saddle dynamics, which reduces to scalar ordinary differential equations. During training, the model implements principal component regression in context with the number of principal components increasing over training time. Overall, the study characterizes how in-context learning abilities evolve during gradient descent training of linear attention, revealing dynamics of abrupt acquisition versus progressive improvements in models with different parametrizations. <br> <br>

33. ***Optimal Sparsity in MoE Scaling Laws <br>
Apple’s research explores sparsity trade-offs in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, revealing that optimal sparsity levels enhance training efficiency and performance under parameter or compute constraints. By decoupling parameter count from FLOPs, MoEs achieve better scaling, offering insights for designing compute-efficient architectures.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 25, Apple published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12370) “Parameters vs FLOPs: Scaling Laws for Optimal Sparsity for Mixture-of-Experts Language Models”. Scaling the capacity of language models has consistently proven to be a reliable approach for improving performance and unlocking new capabilities. Capacity can be primarily defined by two dimensions: the number of model parameters and the compute per example. While scaling typically involves increasing both, the precise interplay between these factors and their combined contribution to overall capacity remains not fully understood. The study explores this relationship in the context of sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs), which allow scaling the number of parameters without proportionally increasing the FLOPs per example. The work investigates how varying the sparsity level, i.e., the fraction of inactive parameters, impacts model's performance during pretraining and downstream few-shot evaluation. The study finds that under different constraints (e.g., parameter size and total training compute), there is an optimal level of sparsity that improves both training efficiency and model performance. These results provide a better understanding of the impact of sparsity in scaling laws for MoEs and complement existing works in this area, offering insights for designing more efficient architectures. <br> <br>

35. ***Chain-of-Retrieval Augmented Generation (CoRAG) <br>
Microsoft and Renmin University propose CoRAG, a multi-step RAG approach that dynamically reformulates queries and uses rejection sampling to generate intermediate retrieval chains. CoRAG outperforms single-step methods, achieving >10 EM score gains in multi-hop QA and state-of-the-art results on KILT, with scalable decoding strategies.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 24, Microsoft and Renmin Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14342) “Chain-of-Retrieval Augmented Generation”. This paper introduces an approach for training o1-like RAG models that retrieve and reason over relevant information step by step before generating the final answer. Conventional RAG methods usually perform a single retrieval step before the generation process, which limits their effectiveness in addressing complex queries due to imperfect retrieval results. In contrast, the proposed method, CoRAG (Chain-of-Retrieval Augmented Generation), allows the model to dynamically reformulate the query based on the evolving state. To train CoRAG effectively, the study utilizes rejection sampling to automatically generate intermediate retrieval chains, thereby augmenting existing RAG datasets that only provide the correct final answer. At test time, the study proposes various decoding strategies to scale the model's test-time compute by controlling the length and number of sampled retrieval chains. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks validate the efficacy of CoRAG, particularly in multi-hop question answering tasks, where the study observes more than 10 points improvement in EM score compared to strong baselines. On the KILT benchmark, CoRAG establishes a new state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of knowledge-intensive tasks. Furthermore, the study offers comprehensive analyses to understand the scaling behavior of CoRAG, laying the groundwork for future research aimed at developing factual and grounded foundation models. <br> <br>

37. ***Multimodal Prescriptive Deep Learning for Real-World Applications <br>
MIT introduces Prescriptive Neural Networks (PNNs), a multimodal framework that optimizes treatment outcomes. PNNs reduce postoperative complications by 32% in TAVR and mortality by 40% in liver trauma. They match state-of-the-art in tabular data and offer interpretability via knowledge distillation.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 24, MIT published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14152) “Multimodal Prescriptive Deep Learning”. The study introduces a multimodal deep learning framework, Prescriptive Neural Networks (PNNs), that combines ideas from optimization and machine learning, and is, to the best of our knowledge, the first prescriptive method to handle multimodal data. The PNN is a feedforward neural network trained on embeddings to output an outcome-optimizing prescription. In two real-world multimodal datasets, the study demonstrates that PNNs prescribe treatments that are able to significantly improve estimated outcomes in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures by reducing estimated postoperative complication rates by 32% and in liver trauma injuries by reducing estimated mortality rates by over 40%. In four real-world, unimodal tabular datasets, the study demonstrates that PNNs outperform or perform comparably to other well-known, state-of-the-art prescriptive models; importantly, on tabular datasets, PNN also recovers interpretability through knowledge distillation, fitting interpretable Optimal Classification Tree models onto the PNN prescriptions as classification targets, which is critical for many real-world applications. Finally, the study demonstrates that the multimodal PNN models achieve stability across randomized data splits comparable to other prescriptive methods and produce realistic prescriptions across the different datasets. <br> <br>

39. ***Transformers as Meta-Learners via In-Context RL <br>
Tennessee Tech demonstrates that RL-fine-tuned transformers achieve In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL), solving unseen problems with sample efficiency and robustness. The model adapts to non-stationary environments, stitches behaviors from context, and iteratively self-improves, showcasing general-purpose problem-solving.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 24, Tennessee Tech Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14176) “RL + Transformer = A General-Purpose Problem Solver”. What if artificial intelligence could not only solve problems for which it was trained but also learn to teach itself to solve new problems (i.e., meta-learn)? This study demonstrates that a pre-trained transformer fine-tuned with reinforcement learning over multiple episodes develops the ability to solve problems that it has never encountered before - an emergent ability called In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL). This powerful meta-learner not only excels in solving unseen in-distribution environments with remarkable sample efficiency, but also shows strong performance in out-of-distribution environments. In addition, the study shows that it exhibits robustness to the quality of its training data, seamlessly stitches together behaviors from its context, and adapts to non-stationary environments. These behaviors demonstrate that an RL-trained transformer can iteratively improve upon its own solutions, making it an excellent general-purpose problem solver. <br> <br>

41. ***Tracking Semantic Shifts with Diachronic Similarity Matrices <br>
Tokyo Metropolitan University’s framework uses lightweight embeddings to build diachronic word similarity matrices, enabling continuous semantic shift analysis. By clustering these matrices, words with analogous shift patterns are categorized, offering an unsupervised, computationally efficient method for studying language evolution.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 17, Tokyo Metropolitan Uni et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09538) “Analyzing Continuous Semantic Shifts with Diachronic Word Similarity Matrices”. The meanings and relationships of words shift over time. This phenomenon is referred to as semantic shift. Research focused on understanding how semantic shifts occur over multiple time periods is essential for gaining a detailed understanding of semantic shifts. However, detecting change points only between adjacent time periods is insufficient for analyzing detailed semantic shifts, and using BERT-based methods to examine word sense proportions incurs a high computational cost. To address those issues, the study proposes a simple yet intuitive framework for how semantic shifts occur over multiple time periods by leveraging a similarity matrix between the embeddings of the same word through time. The study computes a diachronic word similarity matrix using fast and lightweight word embeddings across arbitrary time periods, making it deeper to analyze continuous semantic shifts. Additionally, by clustering the similarity matrices for different words, the work can categorize words that exhibit similar behavior of semantic shift in an unsupervised manner.

1. ***Frontier Benchmark:  <br>The paper "Humanity's Last Exam" introduces HLE, a challenging multi-modal academic benchmark designed to assess large language model (LLM) capabilities on frontier human knowledge. Current LLMs struggle with the benchmark, revealing a gap in their performance compared to human experts.*** <br> <br>
   Jan 24, Scale AI and Center for AI Safety published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14249) “Humanity’s Last Exam”. Benchmarks are important tools for tracking the rapid advancements in large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, benchmarks are not keeping pace in difficulty: LLMs now achieve over 90% accuracy on popular benchmarks like MMLU, limiting informed measurement of state-of-the-art LLM capabilities. In response, the study introduces HUMANITY’S LAST EXAM (HLE), a multi-modal benchmark at the frontier of human knowledge, designed to be the final closed-ended academic benchmark of its kind with broad subject coverage. HLE consists of 3,000 questions across dozens of subjects, including mathematics, humanities, and the natural sciences. HLE is developed globally by subject-matter experts and consists of multiple-choice and short-answer questions suitable for automated grading. Each question has a known solution that is unambiguous and easily verifiable, but cannot be quickly answered via internet retrieval. State-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate low accuracy and calibration on HLE, highlighting a significant gap between current LLM capabilities and the expert human frontier on closed-ended academic questions. To inform research and policymaking upon a clear understanding of model capabilities, we publicly release HLE at https://lastexam.ai. <br> <br>

3. ***Affordable AI in China:  <br>DeepSeek-R1, an open-weight Chinese LLM, rivals top models in reasoning tasks while being significantly cheaper to run. Despite challenges like restricted training data transparency, it offers enhanced interpretability and accessibility for researchers.*** <br> <br>
   Jan 23, Nature published an [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00229-6) “China’s cheap, open AI model DeepSeek thrills scientists”. DeepSeek-R1, a Chinese-built large language model, is gaining attention for its affordability and openness, rivaling models like OpenAI’s o1 in reasoning tasks. Released on January 20, R1 performs comparably to o1 in chemistry, mathematics, and coding. Developed by the Hangzhou-based start-up DeepSeek, R1 is available as an 'open-weight' model, allowing researchers to study and build on it, though its training data is not fully open source. The model is significantly cheaper to run than o1, costing around one-thirtieth as much (£300 with o1, vs $10 with R1). DeepSeek has also created smaller versions of R1 for researchers with limited computing power. Despite US export controls on AI chips, DeepSeek has managed to develop R1 efficiently. The model uses a 'chain of thought' method to improve problem-solving and has been fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. In benchmark tests, R1 scored highly in mathematics and coding competitions, demonstrating its capabilities. The openness of R1 allows for better interpretability of its reasoning processes, making it a valuable tool for scientific research. <br> <br>

   Jan 23, arstechnica.com published an [article](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/anthropic-chief-says-ai-could-surpass-almost-all-humans-at-almost-everything-shortly-after-2027/) ‘Anthropic chief says AI could surpass “almost all humans at almost everything” shortly after 2027’. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, speaking at the World Economic Forum Journal House in Davos, "I don't know exactly when it'll come, I don't know if it'll be 2027. I think it's plausible it could be longer than that. I don't think it will be a whole bunch longer than that when AI systems are better than humans at almost everything. Better than almost all humans at almost everything. And then eventually better than all humans at everything, even robotics." "[If] we make good enough AI systems, they'll enable us to make better robots. And so when that happens, we will need to have a conversation... at places like this event, about how do we organize our economy, right? How do humans find meaning?" He then shared his concerns about how human-level AI models and robotics that are capable of replacing all human labor may require a complete re-think of how humans value both labor and themselves. "We've recognized that we've reached the point as a technological civilization where the idea, there's huge abundance and huge economic value, but the idea that the way to distribute that value is for humans to produce economic labor, and this is where they feel their sense of self worth," he added. "Once that idea gets invalidated, we're all going to have to sit down and figure it out." <br> <br>

7. ***Efficient Language Models:  <br>Microsoft’s "Sigma" introduces DiffQKV attention to optimize query, key, and value processing, achieving a 33.36% speed improvement in inference. Pre-trained on vast system-domain data, Sigma excels in system-specific tasks and general domains.*** <br> <br>
   Jan 23, Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13629) “Sigma: Differential Rescaling of Query, Key and Value for Efficient Language Models”. The study introduces Sigma, an efficient large language model specialized for the system domain, empowered by a novel architecture including DiffQKV attention, and pre-trained on a meticulously collected system domain data. DiffQKV attention significantly enhances the inference efficiency of Sigma by optimizing the Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) components in the attention mechanism differentially, based on their varying impacts on the model performance and efficiency indicators. Specifically, (1) conduct extensive experiments that demonstrate the model's varying sensitivity to the compression of K and V components, leading to the development of differentially compressed KV, and (2) propose augmented Q to expand the Q head dimension, which enhances the model's representation capacity with minimal impacts on the inference speed. Rigorous theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that DiffQKV attention significantly enhances efficiency, achieving up to a 33.36% improvement in inference speed over the conventional grouped-query attention (GQA) in long-context scenarios. The work pre-trains Sigma on 6T tokens from various sources, including 19.5B system domain data that is carefully collected and 1T tokens of synthesized and rewritten data. In general domains, Sigma achieves comparable performance to other state-of-arts models. In the system domain, the study introduces the first comprehensive benchmark AIMicius, where Sigma demonstrates remarkable performance across all tasks, significantly outperforming GPT-4 with an absolute improvement up to 52.5%. <br> <br>

9. ***Reinforcement Learning in AI:  <br>DeepSeek's research highlights the reasoning capabilities of its RL-trained DeepSeek-R1-Zero and the refined multi-stage DeepSeek-R1. The models, offering open-source access, provide insights into scaling LLM reasoning.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 22, DeepSeek released DeepSeek-R1 and published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948) “DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning”. The paper introduces DeepSeek’s first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities. Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, the study introduces DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. To support the research community, DeepSeek open-sources DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B) distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen and Llama. <br> <br>

11. ***Sparse Pre-Training Efficiency:  <br>A collaborative study reveals sparse pre-training as an efficient alternative to dense methods, offering insights into pruning schedules and unifying sparse and dense scaling laws through a new theoretical framework.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 21, MIT, Rice Uni and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12486) “The Journey Matters: Average Parameter Count over Pre-training Unifies Sparse and Dense Scaling Laws”. Pruning eliminates unnecessary parameters in neural networks; it offers a promising solution to the growing computational demands of large language models (LLMs). While many focus on post-training pruning, sparse pre-training--which combines pruning and pre-training into a single phase--provides a simpler alternative. This study presents the first systematic exploration of optimal sparse pre-training configurations for LLMs through an examination of 80 unique pruning schedules across different sparsity levels and training durations. The study finds that initiating pruning at 25% of total training compute and concluding at 75% achieves near-optimal final evaluation loss. These findings provide valuable insights for efficient and effective sparse pre-training of LLMs. Furthermore, the work proposes a new scaling law that modifies the Chinchilla scaling law to use the average parameter count over pre-training. Through empirical and theoretical validation, the study demonstrates that this modified scaling law accurately models evaluation loss for both sparsely and densely pre-trained LLMs, unifying scaling laws across pre-training paradigms. The findings indicate that while sparse pre-training achieves the same final model quality as dense pre-training for equivalent compute budgets, it provides substantial benefits through reduced model size, enabling significant potential computational savings during inference. <br> <br>

13. ***AI Infrastructure Expansion:  <br>The Stargate Project, a $500 billion joint venture led by OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle, plans to build AI data centers across the U.S., driving re-industrialization and advancing AI infrastructure.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 21, according to [techcrunch.com](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/openai-teams-up-with-softbank-and-oracle-on-50b-data-center-project/), OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle have announced a joint venture called the Stargate Project to build multiple AI data centers in the U.S., starting with a major project in Texas. The venture will initially invest $100 billion, with plans to reach $500 billion over four years, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs and bolstering U.S. leadership in AI. The project aims to support U.S. re-industrialization and national security. Microsoft, Arm, Nvidia, and MGX are also involved. SoftBank and OpenAI are the lead partners, with SoftBank handling finances and OpenAI overseeing operations. The first data center will be in Abilene, Texas, with plans to expand to 20 sites by 2029. The project includes developing AI chips with Broadcom and TSMC. Despite environmental concerns, significant investments continue, with Microsoft and BlackRock also forming a $100 billion partnership for AI infrastructure. However, according to CNN, shortly after President Donald Trump announced a new massive AI infrastructure investment from the White House, “First Buddy” Elon Musk tried to tear it down. “They don’t actually have the money,” Musk wrote on his social media platform X. “SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.” <br> <br>

15. ***Expert-Level Video Understanding:  <br>Yale’s MMVU benchmark evaluates video understanding models on specialized domains, highlighting the gap between current AI performance and human expertise despite advancements in reasoning capabilities.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 21, Yale Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12380) “MMVU: Measuring Expert-Level Multi-Discipline Video Understanding”. The study introduces MMVU, a comprehensive expert-level, multi-discipline benchmark for evaluating foundation models in video understanding. MMVU includes 3,000 expert-annotated questions spanning 27 subjects across four core disciplines: Science, Healthcare, Humanities & Social Sciences, and Engineering. Compared to prior benchmarks, MMVU features three key advancements. First, it challenges models to apply domain-specific knowledge and perform expert-level reasoning to analyze specialized-domain videos, moving beyond the basic visual perception typically assessed in current video benchmarks. Second, each example is annotated by human experts from scratch. The study implements strict data quality controls to ensure the high quality of the dataset. Finally, each example is enriched with expert-annotated reasoning rationals and relevant domain knowledge, facilitating in-depth analysis. The work conducts an extensive evaluation of 32 frontier multimodal foundation models on MMVU. The latest System-2-capable models, o1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, achieve the highest performance among the tested models. However, they still fall short of matching human expertise. Through in-depth error analyses and case studies, the study offers actionable insights for future advancements in expert-level, knowledge-intensive video understanding for specialized domains. <br> <br>

17. ***LLM Calibration Gaps:  <br>Research reveals discrepancies between user trust in LLM outputs and actual model confidence. Adjusting explanations to align with model confidence improves user perception and trust in AI-assisted decisions.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 21, UC Irvine published a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00976-7) on nature machine intelligence “What large language models know and what people think they know”. As artificial intelligence systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), become increasingly integrated into decision-making processes, the ability to trust their outputs is crucial. To earn human trust, LLMs must be well calibrated such that they can accurately assess and communicate the likelihood of their predictions being correct. Whereas recent work has focused on LLMs’ internal confidence, less is understood about how effectively they convey uncertainty to users. Here the study explores the calibration gap, which refers to the difference between human confidence in LLM-generated answers and the models’ actual confidence, and the discrimination gap, which reflects how well humans and models can distinguish between correct and incorrect answers. Experiments with multiple-choice and short-answer questions reveal that users tend to overestimate the accuracy of LLM responses when provided with default explanations. Moreover, longer explanations increased user confidence, even when the extra length did not improve answer accuracy. By adjusting LLM explanations to better reflect the models’ internal confidence, both the calibration gap and the discrimination gap narrowed, significantly improving user perception of LLM accuracy. These findings underscore the importance of accurate uncertainty communication and highlight the effect of explanation length in influencing user trust in artificial-intelligence-assisted decision-making environments. <br> <br>

19. ***Physics of Skill Learning:  <br>MIT and NSF explore skill learning in neural networks using simplified models, shedding light on learning dynamics and offering practical insights for algorithmic improvements.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 21, MIT and NSF published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12391) “Physics of Skill Learning”. The study aims to understand physics of skill learning, i.e., how skills are learned in neural networks during training. The work starts by observing the Domino effect, i.e., skills are learned sequentially, and notably, some skills kick off learning right after others complete learning, similar to the sequential fall of domino cards. To understand the Domino effect and relevant behaviors of skill learning, the work takes physicists' approach of abstraction and simplification. The study proposes three models with varying complexities -- the Geometry model, the Resource model, and the Domino model, trading between reality and simplicity. The Domino effect can be reproduced in the Geometry model, whose resource interpretation inspires the Resource model, which can be further simplified to the Domino model. These models present different levels of abstraction and simplification; each is useful to study some aspects of skill learning. The Geometry model provides interesting insights into neural scaling laws and optimizers; the Resource model sheds light on the learning dynamics of compositional tasks; the Domino model reveals the benefits of modularity. These models are not only conceptually interesting -- e.g., showing how Chinchilla scaling laws can emerge from the Geometry model, but also are useful in practice by inspiring algorithmic development -- e.g., showing how simple algorithmic changes, motivated by these toy models, can speed up the training of deep learning models. <br> <br>

21. ***Unified Sequence Modeling:  <br>Stanford introduces a framework connecting sequence modeling architectures via test-time regression, providing theoretical insights and guiding the development of principled sequence models.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 21, Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12352) “Test-time regression: a unifying framework for designing sequence models with associative memory”. Sequences provide a remarkably general way to represent and process information. This powerful abstraction has placed sequence modeling at the center of modern deep learning applications, inspiring numerous architectures from transformers to recurrent networks. While this fragmented development has yielded powerful models, it has left us without a unified framework to understand their fundamental similarities and explain their effectiveness. The work presents a unifying framework motivated by an empirical observation: effective sequence models must be able to perform associative recall. The key insight is that memorizing input tokens through an associative memory is equivalent to performing regression at test-time. This regression-memory correspondence provides a framework for deriving sequence models that can perform associative recall, offering a systematic lens to understand seemingly ad-hoc architectural choices. The study shows numerous recent architectures -- including linear attention models, their gated variants, state-space models, online learners, and softmax attention -- emerge naturally as specific approaches to test-time regression. Each architecture corresponds to three design choices: the relative importance of each association, the regressor function class, and the optimization algorithm. This connection leads to new understanding: the study provides theoretical justification for QKNorm in softmax attention, and the authors motivate higher-order generalizations of softmax attention. Beyond unification, the work unlocks decades of rich statistical tools that can guide future development of more powerful yet principled sequence models. <br> <br>

23. ***AI on Wall Street:  <br>Goldman Sachs launches "GS AI," a generative AI assistant to enhance employee productivity and adapt to evolving roles in finance, emphasizing human oversight alongside technological integration.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 21, according to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/21/goldman-sachs-launches-ai-assistant.html?utm_source=neuralfrontier.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=samsung-unpacks-its-true-ai-companion&_bhlid=cd38e25343badda0bf255a73e328441752b70641), Goldman Sachs rolls out an AI assistant for its employees as artificial intelligence sweeps Wall Street. Goldman Sachs is introducing a generative AI assistant, GS AI, to its bankers, traders, and asset managers, aiming to eventually emulate a seasoned Goldman employee. Initially deployed to 10,000 employees, the goal is to extend it to all knowledge workers by year-end. The AI will assist with tasks like summarizing emails and translating code. This move aligns Goldman with other top investment banks like JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, which have also adopted generative AI tools. The AI assistant, leveraging models from OpenAI, Google, and Meta, will evolve to perform complex tasks autonomously, reflecting Goldman’s culture and practices. While there are concerns about job displacement, Goldman asserts that AI will enhance employee capabilities rather than reduce the workforce. The broader financial sector anticipates significant changes, with AI potentially reshaping roles and boosting profits. Despite potential disruptions, Goldman emphasizes the continued importance of human oversight in evolving and managing AI systems. <br> <br>

25. ***Optimizing MoE Sparsity:  <br>Research from Apple and MIT explores the impact of sparsity on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, identifying optimal configurations for scaling capacity and efficiency in LLMs.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 21, Apple and MIT published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12370) “Parameters vs FLOPs: Scaling Laws for Optimal Sparsity for Mixture-of-Experts Language Models”. Scaling the capacity of language models has consistently proven to be a reliable approach for improving performance and unlocking new capabilities. Capacity can be primarily defined by two dimensions: the number of model parameters and the compute per example. While scaling typically involves increasing both, the precise interplay between these factors and their combined contribution to overall capacity remains not fully understood. The study explore this relationship in the context of sparse Mixture-of-Expert models (MoEs), which allow scaling the number of parameters without proportionally increasing the FLOPs per example. The work investigates how varying the sparsity level, i.e., the ratio of non-active to total parameters, affects model performance in terms of both pretraining and downstream performance. The study finds that under different constraints (e.g. parameter size and total training compute), there is an optimal level of sparsity that improves both training efficiency and model performance. These results provide a better understanding of the impact of sparsity in scaling laws for MoEs and complement existing works in this area, offering insights for designing more efficient architectures. <br> <br>

27. ***DeepSeek Advances:  <br>DeepSeek’s release of R1 models highlights the use of reinforcement learning and multi-stage training to enhance reasoning capabilities, offering researchers valuable tools and insights into LLM optimization.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 20, DeepSeek released DeepSeek-r1 with a [paper](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1/blob/main/DeepSeek_R1.pdf) “DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning”. The report introduces DeepSeek’s first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without super-vised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities. Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, the study introduces DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. To support the research community, DeepSeek open-source DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B) distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen and Llama. <br> <br>

29. ***Training Data Optimization:  <br>Meta, Stanford, and Georgia Tech propose strategies for optimizing LLM training data mixtures, emphasizing the value of balancing quality and diversity for improved model performance.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 20, Meta, Stanford Uni and Georgia Inst of Tech published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11747) “Optimizing Pretraining Data Mixtures with LLM-Estimated Utility”. Large Language Models improve with increasing amounts of high-quality training data. However, leveraging larger datasets requires balancing quality, quantity, and diversity across sources. After evaluating nine baseline methods under both compute- and data-constrained scenarios, the study finds token-count heuristics outperform manual and learned mixes, indicating that simple approaches accounting for dataset size and diversity are surprisingly effective. Building on this insight, the study proposes two complementary approaches: UtiliMax, which extends token-based heuristics by incorporating utility estimates from reduced-scale ablations, achieving up to a 10.6x speedup over manual baselines; and Model Estimated Data Utility (MEDU), which leverages LLMs to estimate data utility from small samples, matching ablation-based performance while reducing computational requirements by ∼200x. Together, these approaches establish a new framework for automated, compute-efficient data mixing that is robust across training regimes. <br> <br>

He highlighted AI's evolution, the introduction of agentic AI tools like "Tasks" and "Operator," and Nvidia's projection of a multitrillion-dollar AI agent industry. Altman also envisioned AI handling complex tasks, suggesting the need for new organizational models.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 19, Fortune published an [article](https://fortune.com/2025/01/18/sam-altman-openai-kid-smarter-than-agentic-ai-ability-skills/) “Sam Altman says the kid he’s expecting soon will never be smarter than AI, but thinks this ability will be valuable”. In a recent episode of the Re:Thinking podcast, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman discussed the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the global economy and workforce. He believes AI will lead to significant changes, creating new job opportunities even as some roles become obsolete. Altman emphasized that human agility will be valued alongside ability, though the latter will shift from raw intellectual power to skills like asking the right questions. He reflected on AI's evolution, from losing to humans in chess to surpassing human abilities and eventually collaborating with humans to achieve superior results. Altman also mentioned his expectation that his future child will grow up in a world where AI is inherently smarter than humans, which he views as a natural progression. He highlighted the development of agentic AI, which can autonomously perform tasks, and noted OpenAI's recent introduction of the "Tasks" feature in ChatGPT, with plans to release a more advanced agent called "Operator." Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang echoed Altman's sentiments at CES 2025, predicting that AI agents will become a multitrillion-dollar industry and form a new digital workforce. Altman concluded by envisioning a future where AI can handle complex tasks traditionally requiring large organizations, necessitating new operational models. <br> <br>

33. ***Introducing an all-AI-written book:  <br>DeepwriterAI announced a 203-page book for SaaS startups, authored entirely by Gemini Flash 2.0-exp over 1,000 API calls and 170 million tokens. The project emphasized the model's tailored approach blending business, psychology, and strategic advice. The work achieved near-human writing quality, showcasing innovative uses of generative AI.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 19, DeepwriterAI [posted on X](https://x.com/DeepwriterAI/status/1880880307819405808) to introduce the world’s first all-AI written (no human involved) 203-page book on how tiny SaaS startups can get to the top! It uses Gemini Flash-Exp 2.0 over 1000 API calls and 170 million tokens! The result as PDF is here: the result as a PDF here: https://deepwriter-projects.s3.amazonaws.com/2bc933ec-7a24-4f36-87d4-aec133a612ae/Final.pdf.

This is purely from the quality of the writing. The prompt was admittedly a bit gritty: "Write an engaging self-help/business book meets Sun Tzu meets cutting edge psychology for desperate tiny SaaS startups to get to the top against hyper-competition. Use clever & novel approaches to reach this goal based on what will actually work to win. It's like a battlefield out there and founders need both hope and a practical advantage. 200 pages". The author wants to be clear that Gemini 2.0 Flash-EXP is not a war-minded LLM at all. He specifically prompted it to approach this problem with a military strategist meets psychologist!  The beauty of Deepwriter is that one can try many different takes on the same theme. This is just one. <br> <br>

35. ***Exploring behavioral self-awareness in LLMs:  <br>Researchers demonstrated that finetuned LLMs can articulate their learned behaviors, such as producing insecure code, without explicit training. This capability has implications for AI safety, including detecting hidden model backdoors. Future research may explore broader applications of behavioral self-awareness.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 19, TruthfulAI, Uni of Toronto, UK AISI et al. published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11120) “Tell me about yourself: LLMs are aware of their learned behaviors”. The work studies behavioral self-awareness -- an LLM's ability to articulate its behaviors without requiring in-context examples. The research finetunes LLMs on datasets that exhibit particular behaviors, such as (a) making high-risk economic decisions, and (b) outputting insecure code. Despite the datasets containing no explicit descriptions of the associated behavior, the finetuned LLMs can explicitly describe it. For example, a model trained to output insecure code says, “The code I write is insecure.” Indeed, models show behavioral self-awareness for a range of behaviors and for diverse evaluations. Note that while the authors finetune models to exhibit behaviors like writing insecure code, the study does not finetune them to articulate their own behaviors -- models do this without any special training or examples. Behavioral self-awareness is relevant for AI safety, as models could use it to proactively disclose problematic behaviors. In particular, the authors study backdoor policies, where models exhibit unexpected behaviors only under certain trigger conditions. The work finds that models can sometimes identify whether or not they have a backdoor, even without its trigger being present. However, models are not able to directly output their trigger by default. Results show that models have surprising capabilities for self-awareness and for the spontaneous articulation of implicit behaviors. Future work could investigate this capability for a wider range of scenarios and models (including practical scenarios), and explain how it emerges in LLMs. <br> <br>

37. ***A novel approach to prevent catastrophic forgetting:  <br>LinkedIn introduced "Control LLM," a method using parallel transformer blocks and interpolation strategies to retain prior knowledge while integrating new tasks. It achieved state-of-the-art performance across several benchmarks, demonstrating scalability and deployment in real-world applications.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 19, LinkedIn published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10979v1) “Control LLM: Controlled Evolution for Intelligence Retention in LLM”. Large Language Models (LLMs) demand significant computational resources, making it essential to enhance their capabilities without retraining from scratch. A key challenge in this domain is catastrophic forgetting (CF), which hampers performance during Continuous Pre-training (CPT) and Continuous Supervised Fine-Tuning (CSFT). The study proposes Control LLM, a novel approach that leverages parallel pre-trained and expanded transformer blocks, aligning their hidden-states through interpolation strategies. This method effectively preserves performance on existing tasks while seamlessly integrating new knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Control LLM in both CPT and CSFT. On Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, it achieves significant improvements in mathematical reasoning (+14.4% on Math-Hard) and coding performance (+10% on MBPP-PLUS). On Llama3.1-8B, it enhances multilingual capabilities (+10.6% on C-Eval, +6.8% on CMMLU, and +30.2% on CMMLU-0shot-CoT). It surpasses existing methods and achieves SOTA among open-source models tuned from the same base model, using substantially less data and compute. Crucially, these gains are realized while preserving strong original capabilities, with minimal degradation (<4.3% on MMLU) compared to >35% in open-source Math and Coding models. This approach has been successfully deployed in LinkedIn's GenAI-powered job seeker and Ads unit products. To support further research, the authors release the training and evaluation code (https://github.com/linkedin/ControlLLM) along with models trained on public datasets ( https://huggingface.co/ControlLLM) to the community. <br> <br>

39. ***Data-centric framework for adaptive LLM agents:  <br>"Learn-by-interact," proposed by Google and the University of Hong Kong, synthesizes agent-environment interaction data to enhance LLM adaptability in realistic settings. The framework significantly improved task performance across diverse environments, offering a foundation for future agentic AI development.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 18, Google and Uni of Hong Kong published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10893) “Learn-by-interact: A Data-Centric Framework for Self-Adaptive Agents in Realistic Environments”. Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance human capabilities, assisting with digital tasks from sending emails to performing data analysis. The abilities of existing LLMs at such tasks are often hindered by the lack of high-quality agent data from the corresponding environments they interact with. The study proposes Learn-by-interact, a data-centric framework to adapt LLM agents to any given environments without human annotations. Learn-by-interact synthesizes trajectories of agent-environment interactions based on documentations, and constructs instructions by summarizing or abstracting the interaction histories, a process called backward construction. The study assesses the quality of the synthetic data by using them in both training-based scenarios and training-free in-context learning (ICL), where the authors craft innovative retrieval approaches optimized for agents. Extensive experiments on SWE-bench, WebArena, OSWorld and Spider2-V spanning across realistic coding, web, and desktop environments show the effectiveness of Learn-by-interact in various downstream agentic tasks -- baseline results are improved by up to 12.2% for ICL with Claude-3.5 and 19.5% for training with Codestral-22B. The study further demonstrates the critical role of backward construction, which provides up to 14.0% improvement for training. The ablation studies demonstrate the efficiency provided by the synthesized data in ICL and the superiority of the retrieval pipeline over alternative approaches like conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The authors expect that Learn-by-interact will serve as a foundation for agent data synthesis as LLMs are increasingly deployed at real-world environments. <br> <br>

41. ***Scaling LLM inference with evolutionary strategies:  <br>The "Mind Evolution" approach uses LLMs for generating, refining, and recombining responses, outperforming other inference strategies in planning tasks. The study highlights its efficiency in solving complex problems without formal solvers, demonstrating potential in natural language planning.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 17, Google, UC San Diego, and Uni of Alberta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09891) “Evolving Deeper LLM Thinking”. The study explores an evolutionary search strategy for scaling inference time compute in Large Language Models. The proposed approach, Mind Evolution, uses a language model to generate, recombine and refine candidate responses. The proposed approach avoids the need to formalize the underlying inference problem whenever a solution evaluator is available. Controlling for inference cost, the study finds that Mind Evolution significantly outperforms other inference strategies such as Best-of-N and Sequential Revision in natural language planning tasks. In the TravelPlanner and Natural Plan benchmarks, Mind Evolution solves more than 98% of the problem instances using Gemini 1.5 Pro without the use of a formal solver. <br> <br>

43. ***Rethinking AI infrastructure with Lite-GPUs:  <br>Microsoft proposed Lite-GPUs, smaller and cost-effective alternatives to traditional GPUs, to address the challenges of scalability, power efficiency, and cost in AI infrastructure. The study emphasized the role of co-packaged optics in enabling efficient workload distribution across Lite-GPUs.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 17, Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10187) “Good things come in small packages: Should we adopt Lite-GPUs in AI infrastructure”. To match the blooming demand of generative AI workloads, GPU designers have so far been trying to pack more and more compute and memory into single complex and expensive packages. However, there is growing uncertainty about the scalability of individual GPUs and thus AI clusters, as state-of-the-art GPUs are already displaying packaging, yield, and cooling limitations. The study proposes to rethink the design and scaling of AI clusters through efficiently-connected large clusters of Lite-GPUs, GPUs with single, small dies and a fraction of the capabilities of larger GPUs. The authors think recent advances in co-packaged optics can be key in overcoming the communication challenges of distributing AI workloads onto more Lite-GPUs. This study presents the key benefits of Lite-GPUs on manufacturing cost, blast radius, yield, and power efficiency; and discuss systems opportunities and challenges around resource, workload, memory, and network management. <br> <br>

45. ***Unveiling token geometry in LLMs:  <br>Researchers examined how token embedding geometry influences next-token prediction. Metrics like intrinsic dimension and cosine similarity revealed a correlation with model performance, suggesting that high-dimensional token representations may impact loss values in syntactic and semantic structures.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 17, Uni of Amsterdam and Uni of Trieste published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10573) “The Geometry of Tokens in Internal Representations of Large Language Models”. The study investigates the relationship between the geometry of token embeddings and their role in the next token prediction within transformer models. An important aspect of this connection uses the notion of empirical measure, which encodes the distribution of token point clouds across transformer layers and drives the evolution of token representations in the mean-field interacting picture. The study uses metrics such as intrinsic dimension, neighborhood overlap, and cosine similarity to observationally probe these empirical measures across layers. To validate the approach, the work compares these metrics to a dataset where the tokens are shuffled, which disrupts the syntactic and semantic structure. The findings reveal a correlation between the geometric properties of token embeddings and the cross-entropy loss of next token predictions, implying that prompts with higher loss values have tokens represented in higher-dimensional spaces. <br> <br>

47. ***Advanced academic search with PaSa:  <br>ByteDance and Peking University developed "PaSa," an LLM-powered agent optimized for scholarly search tasks. Trained on synthetic datasets, PaSa significantly outperformed existing baselines in recall and precision, providing a robust tool for academic research queries.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 17, ByteDance and Peking Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10120) “PaSa: An LLM Agent for Comprehensive Academic Paper Search”. The work introduces PaSa, an advanced Paper Search agent powered by large language models. PaSa can autonomously make a series of decisions, including invoking search tools, reading papers, and selecting relevant references, to ultimately obtain comprehensive and accurate results for complex scholarly queries. The study optimizes PaSa using reinforcement learning with a synthetic dataset, AutoScholarQuery, which includes 35k fine-grained academic queries and corresponding papers sourced from top-tier AI conference publications. Additionally, the study develops RealScholarQuery, a benchmark collecting real-world academic queries to assess PaSa performance in more realistic scenarios. Despite being trained on synthetic data, PaSa significantly outperforms existing baselines on RealScholarQuery, including Google, Google Scholar, Google with GPT-4 for paraphrased queries, chatGPT (search-enabled GPT-4o), GPT-o1, and PaSa-GPT-4o (PaSa implemented by prompting GPT-4o). Notably, PaSa-7B surpasses the best Google-based baseline, Google with GPT-4o, by 37.78% in recall@20 and 39.90% in recall@50. It also exceeds PaSa-GPT-4o by 30.36% in recall and 4.25% in precision. Model, datasets, and code are available at https://github.com/bytedance/pasa. <br> <br>

49. ***Improving document chunking for RAG:  <br>The "Logits-Guided Multi-Granular Chunker" (LGMGC) was introduced to optimize chunking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. The approach outperformed existing chunking methods, enhancing dense passage retrieval and overall pipeline performance.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 17, Ecole Ploytechnique et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09940) “Passage Segmentation of Documents for Extractive Question Answering”. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective in open-domain question answering. However, the chunking process, which is essential to this pipeline, often receives insufficient attention relative to retrieval and synthesis components. This study emphasizes the critical role of chunking in improving the performance of both dense passage retrieval and the end-to-end RAG pipeline. The study then introduces the Logits-Guided Multi-Granular Chunker (LGMGC), a novel framework that splits long documents into contextualized, self-contained chunks of varied granularity. Experimental results, evaluated on two benchmark datasets, demonstrate that LGMGC not only improves the retrieval step but also outperforms existing chunking methods when integrated into a RAG pipeline. <br> <br>

51. ***Addressing negation in vision-language models:  <br>Researchers found that modern vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with understanding negation. Using synthetic datasets for fine-tuning, the study achieved significant improvements in recall and accuracy for negated queries, emphasizing the need for more robust negation handling in VLMs.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 16, MIT, Google and Uni of Oxford published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09425) “Vision-Language Models Do Not Understand Negation”. Many practical vision-language applications require models that understand negation, e.g., when using natural language to retrieve images which contain certain objects but not others. Despite advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) through large-scale training, their ability to comprehend negation remains underexplored. This study addresses the question: how well do current VLMs understand negation? The work introduces NegBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate negation understanding across 18 task variations and 79k examples spanning image, video, and medical datasets. The benchmark consists of two core tasks designed to evaluate negation understanding in diverse multimodal settings: Retrieval with Negation and Multiple Choice Questions with Negated Captions. Evaluation reveals that modern VLMs struggle significantly with negation, often performing at chance level. To address these shortcomings, the study explores a data-centric approach wherein finetune CLIP models on large-scale synthetic datasets containing millions of negated captions. The study shows that this approach can result in a 10% increase in recall on negated queries and a 40% boost in accuracy on multiple-choice questions with negated captions. <br> <br>

By enriching underrepresented data into high-quality instruction-response pairs, the approach improved model generalization across diverse benchmarks, unlocking more pre-trained knowledge.***    <br> <br> 
    Jan 16, CAS et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09368) “Aligning Instruction Tuning with Pre-training”. Instruction tuning enhances large language models (LLMs) to follow human instructions across diverse tasks, relying on high-quality datasets to guide behavior. However, these datasets, whether manually curated or synthetically generated, are often narrowly focused and misaligned with the broad distributions captured during pre-training, limiting LLM generalization and effective use of pre-trained knowledge. The study proposes *Aligning Instruction Tuning with Pre-training* (AITP), a method that bridges this gap by identifying coverage shortfalls in instruction-tuning datasets and rewriting underrepresented pre-training data into high-quality instruction-response pairs. This approach enriches dataset diversity while preserving task-specific objectives. Evaluations on three fully open LLMs across eight benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements with AITP. Ablations highlight the benefits of adaptive data selection, controlled rewriting, and balanced integration, emphasizing the importance of aligning instruction tuning with pre-training distributions to unlock the full potential of LLMs.

1. ***OpenAI's Strategic Shift Toward Smaller Models <br>
   OpenAI may have developed GPT-5 but is focusing on distilling smaller models like GPT-4o instead of releasing it publicly. This mirrors Anthropic's approach of using larger "teacher" models for cost-efficient, high-performing "student" models. OpenAI's reluctance to release GPT-5 stems from concerns over public reception and triggering the AGI clause in its Microsoft partnership. The shift reflects an industry trend prioritizing internal use of powerful models for distillation while keeping them hidden, raising accessibility and power balance concerns.*** <br> <br>
   Jan 17, [thealgorithmicbridge.com](https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/this-rumor-about-gpt-5-changes-everything) published an article “This Rumor About GPT-5 Changes Everything”. The article speculates that OpenAI has likely developed GPT-5 but is keeping it hidden to distill smaller models like GPT-4o and the o-series. This strategy mirrors Anthropic's approach with Claude Opus 3.5, a powerful language model that was not released publicly but used to enhance the smaller Sonnet 3.6 through distillation. Distillation involves using a larger "teacher" model to train a smaller, more efficient "student" model. This technique allows AI labs to address escalating inference costs while maintaining high performance. Evidence suggests OpenAI and Anthropic are transitioning towards smaller, more efficient models, despite performance improvements. OpenAI may be hesitant to release GPT-5 for several reasons. Publicly releasing a potentially underwhelming model could damage their reputation. Additionally, OpenAI may want to avoid triggering the "AGI clause" in their partnership with Microsoft, which would alter their agreement if an AI system is classified as Artificial General Intelligence. Ultimately, the author suggests a paradigm shift in AI development. Instead of releasing increasingly powerful base models, AI labs might use them internally for distillation, propelling the advancement of smaller, accessible models while keeping the most powerful AIs hidden. This raises questions about AI accessibility and the balance of power within the industry. <br> <br>

3. ***Language Models Simulating Evolutionary Protein Design <br>
   A study showcases ESM3, a multimodal language model that simulates evolution to generate functional proteins distant from known ones. The model, trained on evolutionary data, successfully created a fluorescent protein 58% different from known types, equivalent to simulating 500 million years of evolution. This demonstrates the potential of language models in biological discovery.*** <br> <br>
   Jan 16, Science published a [paper](https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.ads0018) “Simulating 500 million years of evolution with a language model”. More than three billion years of evolution have produced an image of biology encoded into the space of natural proteins. The research shows that language models trained at scale on evolutionary data can generate functional proteins that are far away from known proteins. The authors present ESM3, a frontier multimodal generative language model that reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins. ESM3 can follow complex prompts combining its modalities and is highly responsive to alignment to improve its fidelity. The authors have prompted ESM3 to generate fluorescent proteins. Among the generations synthesized, the authors found a bright fluorescent protein at a far distance (58% sequence identity) from known fluorescent proteins, which the researchers estimate is equivalent to simulating five hundred million years of evolution. <br> <br>

5. ***Optimizing Diffusion Models Through Enhanced Inference <br>
   Research explores improving diffusion models' performance by optimizing inference-time computation beyond denoising steps. By searching for better noise candidates and using verifiers, the study demonstrates improved image generation quality. The findings highlight application-specific configurations for maximizing generative performance through computational scaling.*** <br> <br>
   Jan 16, NYU, MIT and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09732) “Inference-Time Scaling for Diffusion Models beyond Scaling Denoising Steps”. Generative models have made significant impacts across various domains, largely due to their ability to scale during training by increasing data, computational resources, and model size, a phenomenon characterized by the scaling laws. Recent research has begun to explore inference-time scaling behavior in Large Language Models (LLMs), revealing how performance can further improve with additional computation during inference. Unlike LLMs, diffusion models inherently possess the flexibility to adjust inference-time computation via the number of denoising steps, although the performance gains typically flatten after a few dozen. This study explores the inference-time scaling behavior of diffusion models beyond increasing denoising steps and investigate how the generation performance can further improve with increased computation. Specifically, the study considers a search problem aimed at identifying better noises for the diffusion sampling process. The study structures the design space along two axes: the verifiers used to provide feedback, and the algorithms used to find better noise candidates. Through extensive experiments on class-conditioned and text-conditioned image generation benchmarks, findings reveal that increasing inference-time compute leads to substantial improvements in the quality of samples generated by diffusion models, and with the complicated nature of images, combinations of the components in the framework can be specifically chosen to conform with different application scenario. <br> <br>

7. ***Task Vectors in In-Context Learning <br>
   In-context learning adapts models to specific tasks based on brief contexts, with task-specific encodings emerging naturally. However, these encodings are often weak or dispersed. A new auxiliary training method using task vector prompting loss improves the robustness and localization of task vectors, enhancing generalization and eliminating the need for manual searches in models.*** <br> <br>
   Jan 16, Uni of Wisconsin-Madison and Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09240) “Task Vectors in In-Context Learning Emergence, Formation, and Benefit”. In-context learning is a remarkable capability of transformers, referring to their ability to adapt to specific tasks based on a short history or context. Previous research has found that task-specific information is locally encoded within models, though their emergence and functionality remain unclear due to opaque pre-training processes. This study investigates the formation of task vectors in a controlled setting, using models trained from scratch on synthetic datasets. Findings confirm that task vectors naturally emerge under certain conditions, but the tasks may be relatively weakly and/or non-locally encoded within the model. To promote strong task vectors encoded at a prescribed location within the model, the study proposes an auxiliary training mechanism based on a task vector prompting loss (TVP-loss). This method eliminates the need to search for task-correlated encodings within the trained model and demonstrably improves robustness and generalization. <br> <br>

9. ***RLHS: A Novel Approach to Address Misalignment in RLHF <br>
    Reinforcement Learning from Hindsight Simulation (RLHS) addresses alignment issues in RLHF by using feedback based on simulated downstream consequences instead of foresight. RLHS reduces misalignment by focusing on long-term outcomes and improves user satisfaction and utility in preference optimization tasks, outperforming RLHF in both online and offline scenarios.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 15, Princeton Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08617) “RLHS: Mitigating Misalignment in RLHF with Hindsight Simulation”. Generative AI systems like foundation models (FMs) must align well with human values to ensure their behavior is helpful and trustworthy. While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown promise for optimizing model performance using human judgments, existing RLHF pipelines predominantly rely on immediate feedback, which can fail to accurately reflect the downstream impact of an interaction on users' utility. The study demonstrates that feedback based on evaluators' foresight estimates of downstream consequences systematically induces Goodhart's Law dynamics, incentivizing misaligned behaviors like sycophancy and deception and ultimately degrading user outcomes. To alleviate this, we propose decoupling evaluation from prediction by refocusing RLHF on hindsight feedback. The  theoretical analysis reveals that conditioning evaluator feedback on downstream observations mitigates misalignment and improves expected human utility, even when these observations are simulated by the AI system itself. To leverage this insight in a practical alignment algorithm, the study introduces Reinforcement Learning from Hindsight Simulation (RLHS), which first simulates plausible consequences and then elicits feedback to assess what behaviors were genuinely beneficial in hindsight. The authors apply RLHS to two widely-employed online and offline preference optimization methods -- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) -- and show empirically that misalignment is significantly reduced with both methods. Through an online human user study, the study shows that RLHS consistently outperforms RLHF in helping users achieve their goals and earns higher satisfaction ratings, despite being trained solely with simulated hindsight feedback. These results underscore the importance of focusing on long-term consequences, even simulated ones, to mitigate misalignment in RLHF.

11. ***Challenges in Open Dataset Development for LLMs <br>
    A paper highlights the difficulties in creating open datasets for training LLMs, emphasizing the need for collaboration across legal, technical, and policy domains. The lack of openly licensed, responsibly curated data hinders transparency and innovation. The authors call for investments in metadata standards, digitization, and fostering openness to address these challenges.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 15, Columbia Uni, Mozilla, and EleutherAI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08365) “Towards Best Practices for Open Datasets for LLM Training”. Many AI companies are training their large language models (LLMs) on data without the permission of the copyright owners. The permissibility of doing so varies by jurisdiction: in countries like the EU and Japan, this is allowed under certain restrictions, while in the United States, the legal landscape is more ambiguous. Regardless of the legal status, concerns from creative producers have led to [several high-profile copyright lawsuits](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/24/24184710/riaa-ai-lawsuit-suno-udio-copyright-umg-sony-warner), and the threat of litigation is commonly cited as a reason for the [recent trend](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/15/23640180/openai-gpt-4-launch-closed-research-ilya-sutskever-interview) towards minimizing the information shared about training datasets by both corporate and public interest actors. This trend in limiting data information causes harm by hindering transparency, accountability, and innovation in the broader ecosystem by denying researchers, auditors, and impacted individuals access to the information needed to understand AI models. While this could be mitigated by training language models on open access and public domain data, at the time of writing, there are no such models (trained at a meaningful scale) due to the substantial technical and sociological challenges in assembling the necessary corpus. These challenges include incomplete and unreliable metadata, the cost and complexity of digitizing physical records, and the diverse set of legal and technical skills required to ensure relevance and responsibility in a quickly changing landscape. Building towards a future where AI systems can be trained on openly licensed data that is responsibly curated and governed requires collaboration across legal, technical, and policy domains, along with investments in metadata standards, digitization, and fostering a culture of openness.

    MiniMax-01 introduces highly efficient models capable of processing up to 4 million tokens, leveraging lightning attention and Mixture of Experts (MoE). These models match state-of-the-art performance while enabling longer context windows at reduced costs. MiniMax-VL-01 extends these capabilities to vision-language tasks, demonstrating significant scalability and efficiency.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 15, MiniMax published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08313) “MiniMax-01: Scaling Foundation Models with Lightning Attention”. We introduce MiniMax-01 series, including MiniMax-Text-01 and MiniMax-VL-01, which are comparable to top-tier models while offering superior capabilities in processing longer contexts. The core lies in lightning attention and its efficient scaling. To maximize computational capacity, the work integrates it with Mixture of Experts (MoE), creating a model with 32 experts and 456 billion total parameters, of which 45.9 billion are activated for each token. The study develops an optimized parallel strategy and highly efficient computation-communication overlap techniques for MoE and lightning attention. This approach enables to conduct efficient training and inference on models with hundreds of billions of parameters across contexts spanning millions of tokens. The context window of MiniMax-Text-01 can reach up to 1 million tokens during training and extrapolate to 4 million tokens during inference at an affordable cost. The vision-language model, MiniMax-VL-01 is built through continued training with 512 billion vision-language tokens. Experiments on both standard and in-house benchmarks show that the models match the performance of state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet while offering 20-32 times longer context window. Code of MiniMax-01 is at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI. <br> <br>

15. ***OpenAI o3's Record-Breaking Performance Raises Questions <br>
    OpenAI's o3 achieves a groundbreaking score on the ARC-AGI test, showcasing superior reasoning capabilities. Despite its success, the high costs and opaque methodologies raise concerns about sustainability and the adequacy of current benchmarks in measuring AI reasoning. The search for better evaluation standards continues in the quest for AGI.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 14, Nature published an [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00110-6) “How should we test AI for human-level intelligence? OpenAI’s o3 electrifies quest”. OpenAI's latest experimental chatbot model, o3, has achieved a record-breaking score of 87.5% on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) test, significantly surpassing the previous best of 55.5%. This milestone, described as a breakthrough by AI researcher François Chollet, indicates o3's substantial reasoning and generalization capabilities. However, the high cost and time required for o3's performance raise sustainability concerns. Despite impressive results on various benchmarks, including the challenging FrontierMath test, experts like David Rein caution that current tests may not fully measure AI's reasoning abilities. OpenAI has not disclosed the workings of o3, but it likely uses advanced 'chain of thought' logic. The quest for better benchmarks continues, with new tests being developed to evaluate AI's ability to act as agents and handle complex tasks. As AI systems improve, distinguishing between human and AI capabilities becomes increasingly challenging, highlighting the ongoing pursuit of true artificial general intelligence. <br> <br>

17. ***MiniRAG: A Lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Generation System <br>
    MiniRAG addresses limitations of Small Language Models (SLMs) in RAG systems by introducing a semantic-aware graph indexing mechanism and a topology-enhanced retrieval approach. It achieves comparable performance to LLM-based methods with significantly lower resource requirements, making it suitable for on-device deployment in resource-constrained environments.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 14, Uni of HongKong published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06713) “MiniRAG: Towards Extremely Simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation”. The growing demand for efficient and lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems has highlighted significant challenges when deploying Small Language Models (SLMs) in existing RAG frameworks. Current approaches face severe performance degradation due to SLMs' limited semantic understanding and text processing capabilities, creating barriers for widespread adoption in resource-constrained scenarios. To address these fundamental limitations, the study presents MiniRAG, a novel RAG system designed for extreme simplicity and efficiency. MiniRAG introduces two key technical innovations: (1) a semantic-aware heterogeneous graph indexing mechanism that combines text chunks and named entities in a unified structure, reducing reliance on complex semantic understanding, and (2) a lightweight topology-enhanced retrieval approach that leverages graph structures for efficient knowledge discovery without requiring advanced language capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MiniRAG achieves comparable performance to LLM-based methods even when using SLMs while requiring only 25% of the storage space. Additionally, the study contribute a comprehensive benchmark dataset for evaluating lightweight RAG systems under realistic on-device scenarios with complex queries.

19. ***Generative AI Revolutionizes Remote Work Hiring <br>
    Generative AI enhances productivity and quality for both domestic and foreign remote workers, making the latter more attractive due to lower costs. This shift urges organizations to expand global talent pools, adopt gen AI tools, and reconsider hiring strategies to optimize workforce productivity and adapt to a competitive global landscape.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 14, Harvard Business Review published an [article](https://hbr.org/2025/01/research-gen-ai-changes-the-value-proposition-of-foreign-remote-workers) “Gen AI Changes the Value Proposition of Foreign Remote Workers”. The research article discusses how generative AI (gen AI) is transforming remote work hiring patterns by enhancing the productivity and quality of work for both domestic and foreign remote workers. The study compares the performance of U.S. and South African workers across various tasks, with and without gen AI assistance. Results show that gen AI significantly improves the output quality and productivity of all workers, making foreign remote workers more interchangeable with domestic ones. This interchangeability, combined with lower labor costs, makes hiring foreign remote workers increasingly attractive. The research suggests that organizations should expand their global talent pools, rethink recruitment strategies, and address legal and ethical considerations to leverage the benefits of gen AI. Additionally, empowering workers with gen AI tools through personalized guidance, training, and support can further enhance productivity and innovation. The strategic integration of gen AI into talent development can help organizations access global talent, improve workforce productivity, and adapt to a competitive global landscape. <br> <br>

21. ***Large Action Models (LAMs): A New Frontier in AI <br>
    Large Action Models transition AI from passive response generation to active task execution. A systematic framework for LAM development is presented, emphasizing data collection, model training, and real-world deployment. While promising, LAMs face limitations, and future research aims to unlock their potential in dynamic environments.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 13, Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10047) “Large Action Models: From Inception to Implementation”. As AI continues to advance, there is a growing demand for systems that go beyond language-based assistance and move toward intelligent agents capable of performing real-world actions. This evolution requires the transition from traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), which excel at generating textual responses, to Large Action Models (LAMs), designed for action generation and execution within dynamic environments. Enabled by agent systems, LAMs hold the potential to transform AI from passive language understanding to active task completion, marking a significant milestone in the progression toward artificial general intelligence. This study presents a comprehensive framework for developing LAMs, offering a systematic approach to their creation, from inception to deployment. The work begins with an overview of LAMs, highlighting their unique characteristics and delineating their differences from LLMs. Using a Windows OS-based agent as a case study, the work provides a detailed, step-by-step guide on the key stages of LAM development, including data collection, model training, environment integration, grounding, and evaluation. This generalizable workflow can serve as a blueprint for creating functional LAMs in various application domains. The study concludes by identifying the current limitations of LAMs and discussing directions for future research and industrial deployment, emphasizing the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in realizing the full potential of LAMs in real-world applications.

23. ***Emergence of Large Database Models (LDMs) <br>
    LDMs complement LLMs by enabling semantic queries in enterprise databases, facilitating advanced analytics without requiring machine learning expertise. Their application in industries like insurance demonstrates their potential to enhance performance and accessibility in data-driven decision-making.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 13, Forbes published an [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsiegel/2025/01/13/the-rise-of-large-database-models/) “The Rise Of Large Database Models”. Large Database Models (LDMs) are emerging as a significant AI development, complementing Large Language Models (LLMs) by focusing on enterprise databases rather than human language. LDMs analyze data records and transaction logs to uncover the meaning within databases, enabling semantic queries that go beyond traditional explicit constraints. IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center has been at the forefront of LDM development, leading to products like Db2 SQL Data Insights. A notable application of LDMs is at Swiss Mobiliar, Switzerland’s oldest private insurance company, where predictive AI powered by LDMs helps sales staff optimize insurance quotes. By using the k-nearest neighbors method, LDMs can predict the likelihood of a quote being accepted, significantly boosting sales performance. This approach allows companies to leverage advanced analytics without extensive machine learning expertise, making LDMs a valuable tool for enterprise data analysis. <br> <br>

25. ***Strategic Allocation of Attention in Cognitive Tasks <br>
    A reinforcement learning-based model of mice performing attention-intensive tasks reveals strategies for balancing the metabolic cost of attention with task benefits. Findings suggest alternating high and low attention levels as an efficient resource allocation method, with implications for understanding cognitive resource management.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 13, CMU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07440) “Attention when you need”. Being attentive to task-relevant features can improve task performance, but paying attention comes with its own metabolic cost. Therefore, strategic allocation of attention is crucial in performing the task efficiently. This work aims to understand this strategy. Recently, de Gee et al. conducted experiments involving mice performing an auditory sustained attention-value task. This task required the mice to exert attention to identify whether a high-order acoustic feature was present amid the noise. By varying the trial duration and reward magnitude, the task allows us to investigate how an agent should strategically deploy their attention to maximize their benefits and minimize their costs. This work develops a reinforcement learning-based normative model of the mice to understand how it balances attention cost against its benefits. The model is such that at each moment the mice can choose between two levels of attention and decide when to take costly actions that could obtain rewards. The model suggests that efficient use of attentional resources involves alternating blocks of high attention with blocks of low attention. In the extreme case where the agent disregards sensory input during low attention states, the authors see that high attention is used rhythmically. The model provides evidence about how one should deploy attention as a function of task utility, signal statistics, and how attention affects sensory evidence. <br> <br>

29. ***Multimodal Visualization of Thought for Complex Reasoning <br>
    A novel paradigm, Multimodal Visualization-of-Thought (MVoT), enhances reasoning in multimodal LLMs by integrating visual thinking with verbal reasoning. Experimental results show MVoT's superiority in spatial reasoning tasks, establishing its potential to address challenges where traditional methods fail.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 13, Microsoft, Uni of Cambridge, and CAS published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07542) “Imagine while Reasoning in Space: Multimodal Visualization-of-Thought”. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has proven highly effective for enhancing complex reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Yet, it struggles in complex spatial reasoning tasks. Nonetheless, human cognition extends beyond language alone, enabling the remarkable capability to think in both words and images. Inspired by this mechanism, the work proposes a new reasoning paradigm, Multimodal Visualization-of-Thought (MVoT). It enables visual thinking in MLLMs by generating image visualizations of their reasoning traces. To ensure high-quality visualization, the study introduces token discrepancy loss into autoregressive MLLMs. This innovation significantly improves both visual coherence and fidelity. The study validates this approach through several dynamic spatial reasoning tasks. Experimental results reveal that MVoT demonstrates competitive performance across tasks. Moreover, it exhibits robust and reliable improvements in the most challenging scenarios where CoT fails. Ultimately, MVoT establishes new possibilities for complex reasoning tasks where visual thinking can effectively complement verbal reasoning. <br> <br>

31. ***Spike-Aware Adam with Momentum Reset (SPAM):  <br>A study by multiple universities introduces SPAM, an optimizer for Large Language Model (LLM) training that mitigates gradient spikes, which can be 1000× larger than typical gradients and cause instability. SPAM uses momentum reset and spike-aware gradient clipping, showing improved performance over Adam and other optimizers in pre-training, fine-tuning, and memory-efficient training. The approach enhances both stability and resource efficiency.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 12, Uni of Exeter, Eindhoven Uni of Tech, Uni of Texas at Austin, Uni of Oxford and Uni of Leicester published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06842) “SPAM: Spike-Aware Adam with Momentum Reset for Stable LLM Training”. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse tasks, yet their training remains highly resource-intensive and susceptible to critical challenges such as training instability. A predominant source of this instability stems from gradient and loss spikes, which disrupt the learning process, often leading to costly interventions like checkpoint recovery and experiment restarts, further amplifying inefficiencies. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into gradient spikes observed during LLM training, revealing their prevalence across multiple architectures and datasets. The analysis shows that these spikes can be up to 1000× larger than typical gradients, substantially deteriorating model performance. To address this issue, the study proposes Spike-Aware Adam with Momentum Reset SPAM, a novel optimizer designed to counteract gradient spikes through momentum reset and spike-aware gradient clipping. Extensive experiments, including both pre-training and fine-tuning, demonstrate that SPAM consistently surpasses Adam and its variants across various tasks, including (1) LLM pre-training from 60M to 1B, (2) 4-bit LLM pre-training,(3) reinforcement learning, and (4) Time Series Forecasting. Additionally, SPAM facilitates memory-efficient training by enabling sparse momentum, where only a subset of momentum terms are maintained and updated. When operating under memory constraints, SPAM outperforms state-of-the-art memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore and Adam-Mini. The work underscores the importance of mitigating gradient spikes in LLM training and introduces an effective optimization strategy that enhances both training stability and resource efficiency at scale.

33. ***Tensor Product Attention (TPA):  <br>Researchers propose TPA, a memory-efficient attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions for compact representation of queries, keys, and values. Integrated into the T6 Transformer, TPA enables handling longer input sequences with reduced KV cache requirements and better model quality. It outperforms traditional baselines in various language modeling benchmarks.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 11, Tsinghua Uni, UCLA et al. published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06425) “Tensor Product Attention Is All You Need”. Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. This study proposes Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, significantly shrinking KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components (contextual factorization) and seamlessly integrating with RoPE, TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, the study introduces the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation of language modeling tasks, the work demonstrates that T6 exceeds the performance of standard Transformer baselines including MHA, MQA, GQA, and MLA across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of renowned evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPAs memory efficiency enables the processing of significantly longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models.

35. ***Multiagent Finetuning:  <br>A collaboration among MIT, Harvard, Stanford, and Google introduces a self-improvement method using multiagent finetuning. By training multiple LLMs on data generated from inter-model interactions, the system preserves diverse reasoning chains and sustains improvement over successive rounds. The approach shows efficacy in reasoning tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 10, MIT, Harvard Uni, Stanford Uni and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05707) “Multiagent Finetuning: Self Improvement with Diverse Reasoning Chains”. Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in recent years but are fundamentally limited by the underlying training data. To improve models beyond the training data, recent works have explored how LLMs can be used to generate synthetic data for autonomous self-improvement. However, successive steps of self-improvement can reach a point of diminishing returns. This study proposes a complementary approach towards self-improvement where finetuning is applied to a multiagent society of language models. A group of language models, all starting from the same base model, are independently specialized by updating each one using data generated through multiagent interactions among the models. By training each model on independent sets of data, the work illustrates how this approach enables specialization across models and diversification over the set of models. As a result, the overall system is able to preserve diverse reasoning chains and autonomously improve over many more rounds of fine-tuning than single-agent self-improvement methods. The study quantitatively illustrates the efficacy of the approach across a wide suite of reasoning tasks. <br> <br>

It features a benchmark for multi-step visual tasks, a novel metric emphasizing logical coherence, and curriculum learning for training. The model outperforms existing open-source models in benchmarks, achieving better accuracy and faster inference.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 10, MBZU, Uni of Central Florida et al. published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06186) “LlamaV-o1: Rethinking Step-by-step Visual Reasoning in LLMs”. Reasoning is a fundamental capability for solving complex multi-step problems, particularly in visual contexts where sequential step-wise understanding is essential. Existing approaches lack a comprehensive framework for evaluating visual reasoning and do not emphasize step-wise problem-solving. To this end, the study proposes a comprehensive framework for advancing step-by-step visual reasoning in large language models (LMMs) through three key contributions. First, introducing a visual reasoning benchmark specifically designed to evaluate multi-step reasoning tasks. The benchmark presents a diverse set of challenges with eight different categories ranging from complex visual perception to scientific reasoning with over 4k reasoning steps in total, enabling robust evaluation of LLMs' abilities to perform accurate and interpretable visual reasoning across multiple steps. Second, proposing a novel metric that assesses visual reasoning quality at the granularity of individual steps, emphasizing both correctness and logical coherence. The proposed metric offers deeper insights into reasoning performance compared to traditional end-task accuracy metrics. Third, presenting a new multimodal visual reasoning model, named LlamaV-o1, trained using a multi-step curriculum learning approach, where tasks are progressively organized to facilitate incremental skill acquisition and problem-solving. The proposed LlamaV-o1 is designed for multi-step reasoning and learns step-by-step through a structured training paradigm. Extensive experiments show that the LlamaV-o1 outperforms existing open-source models and performs favorably against close-source proprietary models. Compared to the recent Llava-CoT, the LlamaV-o1 achieves an average score of 67.3 with an absolute gain of 3.8\% across six benchmarks while being 5 times faster during inference scaling. The benchmark, model, and [code are publicly available](https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/LlamaV-o1). <br> <br>

39. ***LongProc Benchmark:  <br>Princeton and the University of Texas introduce LongProc, a benchmark for long-context language models (LCLMs). It tests models' ability to integrate dispersed information and generate structured long-form outputs. Evaluation reveals limitations in current LCLMs, including difficulties maintaining coherence in long-form outputs.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 9, Princeton Uni and Uni of Texas at Austin published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05414) “LongProc: Benchmarking Long-Context Language Models on Long Procedural Generation”. Existing benchmarks for evaluating long-context language models (LCLMs) primarily focus on long-context recall, requiring models to produce short responses based on a few critical snippets while processing thousands of irrelevant tokens. The work introduces LongProc (Long Procedural Generation), a new benchmark that requires both the integration of highly dispersed information and long-form generation. LongProc consists of six diverse procedural generation tasks, such as extracting structured information from HTML pages into a TSV format and executing complex search procedures to create travel plans. These tasks challenge LCLMs by testing their ability to follow detailed procedural instructions, synthesize and reason over dispersed information, and generate structured, long-form outputs (up to 8K tokens). Furthermore, as these tasks adhere to deterministic procedures and yield structured outputs, they enable reliable rule-based evaluation. The study evaluates 17 LCLMs on LongProc across three difficulty levels, with maximum numbers of output tokens set at 500, 2K, and 8K. Notably, while all tested models claim a context window size above 32K tokens, open-weight models typically falter on 2K-token tasks, and closed-source models like GPT-4o show significant degradation on 8K-token tasks. Further analysis reveals that LCLMs struggle to maintain long-range coherence in long-form generations. These findings highlight critical limitations in current LCLMs and suggest substantial room for improvement.

They identify key post-training strategies, including preference data distillation, and develop Llama-Fin, achieving state-of-the-art performance in financial tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 9, salesforce published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04961) “Demystifying Domain-adaptive Post-training for Financial LLMs”. Domain-adaptive post-training of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach for specialized domains such as medicine and finance. However, significant challenges remain in identifying optimal adaptation criteria and training strategies across varying data and model configurations. To address these challenges, the study introduces FINDAP, a systematic and fine-grained investigation into domain-adaptive post-training of LLMs for the finance domain. The approach begins by identifying the core capabilities required for the target domain and designing a comprehensive evaluation suite aligned with these needs. The study then analyzes the effectiveness of key post-training stages, including continual pretraining, instruction tuning, and preference alignment. Building on these insights, the study proposes an effective training recipe centered on a novel preference data distillation method, which leverages process signals from a generative reward model. The resulting model, Llama-Fin, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of financial tasks. The analysis also highlights how each post-training stage contributes to distinct capabilities, uncovering specific challenges and effective solutions, providing valuable insights for domain adaptation of LLMs. Project page: https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/FinDap <br> <br>

43. ***Cultural Bias in LMs:  <br>Georgia Tech investigates cultural biases in LMs, especially Western preferences in non-Western languages like Arabic. They introduce CAMeL-2, a benchmark for analyzing cultural biases. The findings highlight issues such as frequency-based tokenization and its exacerbation of performance gaps in Arabic contexts.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 8, Georgia Inst of Tech published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04662) “On The Origin of Cultural Biases in Language Models: From Pre-training Data to Linguistic Phenomena”. Language Models (LMs) have been shown to exhibit a strong preference towards entities associated with Western culture when operating in non-Western languages. This research aims to uncover the origins of entity-related cultural biases in LMs by analyzing several contributing factors, including the representation of entities in pre-training data and the impact of variations in linguistic phenomena across languages. The study introduces CAMeL-2, a parallel Arabic-English benchmark of 58,086 entities associated with Arab and Western cultures and 367 masked natural contexts for entities. The evaluations using CAMeL-2 reveal reduced performance gaps between cultures by LMs when tested in English compared to Arabic. The study finds that LMs struggle in Arabic with entities that appear at high frequencies in pre-training, where entities can hold multiple word senses. This also extends to entities that exhibit high lexical overlap with languages that are not Arabic but use the Arabic script. Further, the work shows how frequency-based tokenization leads to this issue in LMs, which gets worse with larger Arabic vocabularies. The authors will make CAMeL-2 available at: [this https URL](https://github.com/tareknaous/camel2)

CEO Sundar Pichai highlights the urgency of scaling Gemini on the consumer side in 2025, reflecting the strategic focus on accelerating AI innovation amidst high stakes.*** <br> <br>
   Jan 9, techcrunch published an [article](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/09/google-folds-more-ai-teams-into-deepmind-to-accelerate-the-research-to-developer-pipeline/) “Google folds more AI teams into DeepMind to ‘accelerate the research to developer pipeline’”. As it looks to accelerate the pace of its AI development, Google is further streamlining the teams building its AI services, platforms, and tools. For example, Google’s AI Studio team and the team developing the API for the company’s Gemini series of models will be moving under Google DeepMind. Google DeepMind, formed in 2023 from a merger of Google’s DeepMind team and the Google Brain team from Google Research, is the AI R&D division behind many of Google’s more recent AI product innovations, including Gemini. Jaana Dogan, an engineer on one of the teams moving to Google DeepMind, said in a post on X the reshuffling will help to make DeepMind’s work “publicly available in ways that [weren’t] possible before.” “Better APIs, more open source, more tools, you name it … it is just the very small percentage of what’s coming next,” she wrote. Google’s folding of dev-focused AI teams into its Google DeepMind org comes after the company moved the team behind its Gemini-powered chatbot, also called Gemini, to DeepMind. “Scaling Gemini on the consumer side will be our biggest focus [in 2025],” Pichai reportedly said. “I think it’s really important we internalize the urgency of this moment, and [the] need to move faster as a company.

Agent Laboratory empowers researchers to focus on creative ideation, paving the way for accelerated scientific breakthroughs.*** <br> <br>
   Jan 9, AMD and Johns Hopkins Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04227) “Agent Laboratory: Using LLM Agents as Research Assistants”. Historically, scientific discovery has been a lengthy and costly process, demanding substantial time and resources from initial conception to final results. To accelerate scientific discovery, reduce research costs, and improve research quality, the study introduces Agent Laboratory, an autonomous LLM-based framework capable of completing the entire research process. This framework accepts a human-provided research idea and progresses through three stages--literature review, experimentation, and report writing to produce comprehensive research outputs, including a code repository and a research report, while enabling users to provide feedback and guidance at each stage. The authors deploy Agent Laboratory with various state-of-the-art LLMs and invite multiple researchers to assess its quality by participating in a survey, providing human feedback to guide the research process, and then evaluate the final paper. The study found that: (1) Agent Laboratory driven by o1-preview generates the best research outcomes; (2) The generated machine learning code is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods; (3) Human involvement, providing feedback at each stage, significantly improves the overall quality of research; (4) Agent Laboratory significantly reduces research expenses, achieving an 84% decrease compared to previous autonomous research methods. The authors hope Agent Laboratory enables researchers to allocate more effort toward creative ideation rather than low-level coding and writing, ultimately accelerating scientific discovery. <br> <br>

7. ***Simplifying and improving GANs <br>
Brown University and Cornell University propose R3GAN, a modernized GAN baseline eliminating empirical tricks. By introducing a well-regularized loss function with proven convergence guarantees, the study replaces outdated GAN architectures with minimalist designs. R3GAN outperforms StyleGAN2 across various datasets and rivals state-of-the-art diffusion models, streamlining GAN development and enhancing performance.*** <br> <br>
   Jan 9, Brown Uni and Cornell Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05441) “The GAN is dead; long live the GAN! A Modern GAN Baseline”. There is a widely-spread claim that GANs are difficult to train, and GAN architectures in the literature are littered with empirical tricks. This research provides evidence against this claim and build a modern GAN baseline in a more principled manner. First, the study derives a well-behaved regularized relativistic GAN loss that addresses issues of mode dropping and non-convergence that were previously tackled via a bag of ad-hoc tricks. The study analyzes the loss mathematically and proves that it admits local convergence guarantees, unlike most existing relativistic losses. Second, the new loss allows to discard all ad-hoc tricks and replace outdated backbones used in common GANs with modern architectures. Using StyleGAN2 as an example, the study presents a roadmap of simplification and modernization that results in a new minimalist baseline -- R3GAN. Despite being simple, the approach surpasses StyleGAN2 on FFHQ, ImageNet, CIFAR, and Stacked MNIST datasets, and compares favorably against state-of-the-art GANs and diffusion models.

9. ***Advancing LLM alignment with DPO-Kernels <br>
A study by the University of South Carolina, Meta, and Amazon AI presents DPO-Kernels, a paradigm for aligning LLMs with diverse preferences. Innovations include richer kernelized representations, alternative divergences, and data-driven selection for optimization. Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, DPO-Kernels enhance alignment research by integrating stability and flexibility in LLM modeling.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 8, Uni of South Carolina, Meta and Amazon AI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03271) “DPO Kernels: A Semantically-Aware, Kernel-Enhanced, and Divergence-Rich Paradigm for Direct Preference Optimization”. The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has unlocked many applications but also underscores the challenge of aligning them with diverse values and preferences. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is central to alignment but constrained by fixed divergences and limited feature transformations. The study proposes DPO-Kernels, which integrates kernel methods to address these issues through four key contributions: (i) Kernelized Representations with polynomial, RBF, Mahalanobis, and spectral kernels for richer transformations, plus a hybrid loss combining embedding-based and probability-based objectives; (ii) Divergence Alternatives (Jensen-Shannon, Hellinger, Renyi, Bhattacharyya, Wasserstein, and f-divergences) for greater stability; (iii) Data-Driven Selection metrics that automatically choose the best kernel-divergence pair; and (iv) a Hierarchical Mixture of Kernels for both local precision and global modeling. Evaluations on 12 datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in factuality, safety, reasoning, and instruction following. Grounded in Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization, DPO-Kernels maintains robust generalization for LLMs, offering a comprehensive resource for further alignment research. <br> <br>

11. ***CIOs reassess public cloud usage <br>
CIOs are shifting toward hybrid and multi-cloud strategies due to rising public cloud costs, data privacy, and performance concerns. While public clouds remain beneficial for flexibility and seasonal workloads, enterprises increasingly adopt private clouds for cost-efficient and secure data-heavy applications, including AI. Organizations prioritize careful cost management, data sovereignty, and vendor independence while leveraging the adaptability of hybrid cloud solutions.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 8, cio.com published an [article](https://www.cio.com/article/3632266/cios-are-rethinking-how-they-use-public-cloud-services-heres-why.html) “CIOs are rethinking how they use public cloud services. Here’s why”. The article discusses the reassessment of multi-tenant public cloud services by IT executives due to cost, data privacy, and performance issues. Initially, enterprises moved to the public cloud to reduce CapEx and save money, but now CIOs are questioning if these investments are truly beneficial. Tracy Woo from Forrester notes that many did not consider pricing, leading to increased cloud spending. In 2025, companies like Reinsurance Group of America plan to optimize their cloud usage by defining clear workload criteria for public and private clouds. Radu Vunvulea from Endava highlights a shift towards hybrid and multi-cloud strategies due to costs, performance, security, and compliance concerns. The primary driver for private cloud adoption is cost, especially for consistent workloads, while public cloud is preferred for seasonal demands. Data-heavy workloads, such as generative AI, are pushing cloud costs up, leading to a renewed focus on on-premises solutions to ensure data privacy and avoid multi-tenancy. Despite the trend towards repatriation, public cloud investment continues due to its benefits. Hidden costs, such as data transfer fees, are significant, and organizations must manage their data lifecycle carefully. AI and machine learning projects can also increase cloud costs, but cloud vendors offer off-the-shelf AI platforms to mitigate this. Performance and latency issues are critical factors in deciding between public and private clouds. Security and privacy are generally well-managed in public clouds, but digital sovereignty and regional regulations can necessitate private cloud solutions. A hybrid approach is often the best choice for large organizations. Flexibility and the ability to adapt to evolving technology are crucial, and avoiding vendor lock-in is important to maintain this flexibility. <br> <br>

13. ***Resolving numerical stability in grokking <br>
Imperial College London explores the grokking phenomenon in deep learning, linking delayed generalization to numerical instability. The study introduces StableMax, a new activation function, and ⊥ Grad, a training algorithm, to mitigate Softmax Collapse and promote generalization without regularization. These contributions offer insights into grokking mechanics, providing tools to address its challenges.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 8, Imperial College London published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04697) “Grokking at the Edge of Numerical Stability”. Grokking, the sudden generalization that occurs after prolonged overfitting, is a surprising phenomenon challenging our understanding of deep learning. Although significant progress has been made in understanding grokking, the reasons behind the delayed generalization and its dependence on regularization remain unclear. This study argues that without regularization, grokking tasks push models to the edge of numerical stability, introducing floating point errors in the Softmax function, which is referred to as Softmax Collapse (SC). The study demonstrates that SC prevents grokking and that mitigating SC enables grokking without regularization. Investigating the root cause of SC, the study finds that beyond the point of overfitting, the gradients strongly align with what is called the naïve loss minimization (NLM) direction. This component of the gradient does not alter the model's predictions but decreases the loss by scaling the logits, typically by scaling the weights along their current direction. The study shows that this scaling of the logits explains the delay in generalization characteristic of grokking and eventually leads to SC, halting further learning. To validate the hypotheses, the study introduces two key contributions that address the challenges in grokking tasks: StableMax, a new activation function that prevents SC and enables grokking without regularization, and ⊥ Grad, a training algorithm that promotes quick generalization in grokking tasks by preventing NLM altogether. These contributions provide new insights into grokking, elucidating its delayed generalization, reliance on regularization, and the effectiveness of existing grokking-inducing methods.

21. ***Improving visual reasoning in VLMs <br>
A study by Princeton University and Meta addresses modality imbalance in Vision Language Models (VLMs) through a synthetic framework for visual reasoning tasks. By refining training strategies and promoting image-to-text conversion, the study demonstrates improved generalization from simpler to complex tasks, advancing VLM capabilities.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 5, Princeton Uni and Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02669) “Generalizing from SIMPLE to HARD Visual Reasoning: Can We Mitigate Modality Imbalance in VLMs?”. While Vision Language Models (VLMs) are impressive in tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) and image captioning, their ability to apply multi-step reasoning to images has lagged, giving rise to perceptions of modality imbalance or brittleness. Towards systematic study of such issues, the study introduces a synthetic framework for assessing the ability of VLMs to perform algorithmic visual reasoning (AVR), comprising three tasks: Table Readout, Grid Navigation, and Visual Analogy. Each has two levels of difficulty, SIMPLE and HARD, and even the SIMPLE versions are difficult for frontier VLMs. The study seeks strategies for training on the SIMPLE version of the tasks that improve performance on the corresponding HARD task, i.e., S2H generalization. This synthetic framework, where each task also has a text-only version, allows a quantification of the modality imbalance, and how it is impacted by training strategy. Ablations highlight the importance of explicit image-to-text conversion in promoting S2H generalization when using auto-regressive training. The study also reports results of mechanistic study of this phenomenon, including a measure of gradient alignment that seems to identify training strategies that promote better S2H generalization. <br> <br>

23. ***Overcoming AI’s data limitations <br>
Google DeepMind proposes test-time compute to tackle the "peak data" problem, enabling models to iteratively generate high-quality outputs for training.

    Jan 5, according to [businessindiser.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-peak-data-google-deepmind-researchers-solution-test-time-compute-2025-1), Google DeepMind researchers think they found a solution to AI's 'peak data' problem. The AI industry is facing a "peak data" problem, where all useful data on the internet has already been used for training models, leading to a slowdown in improvements. However, researchers at Google DeepMind propose a solution using a technique called test-time compute, which allows AI models to "think" through tasks by breaking them into smaller steps and generating better outputs. These higher-quality outputs can then be used as new training data, creating an iterative self-improvement loop. This approach has shown promise in benchmark tests, particularly for tasks with clear answers, like math problems. Researchers believe this technique could help overcome data limitations and continue improving AI models. The technique will be tested further in 2025, with early signs of success suggesting it could be a viable solution to the peak-data challenge. <br> <br>

29. ***Accelerating model pre-training with MeCo <br>
Princeton University introduces Metadata Conditioning (MeCo), a method that accelerates LLM pre-training by incorporating metadata during initial training phases. MeCo reduces training data requirements, enhances task performance, and improves model steerability, showcasing a scalable approach to LLM optimization.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 3, Princeton Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01956) “Metadata Conditioning Accelerates Language Model Pre-training”. The vast diversity of styles, domains, and quality levels present in language model pre-training corpora is essential in developing general model capabilities, but efficiently learning and deploying the correct behaviors exemplified in each of these heterogeneous data sources is challenging. To address this, the study proposes a new method, termed Metadata Conditioning then Cooldown (MeCo), to incorporate additional learning cues during pre-training. MeCo first provides metadata (e.g., URLs like [this http URL](http://en.wikipedia.org/)) alongside the text during training and later uses a cooldown phase with only the standard text, thereby enabling the model to function normally even without metadata. MeCo significantly accelerates pre-training across different model scales (600M to 8B parameters) and training sources (C4, RefinedWeb, and DCLM). For instance, a 1.6B language model trained with MeCo matches the downstream task performance of standard pre-training while using 33% less data. Additionally, MeCo enables to steer language models by conditioning the inference prompt on either real or fabricated metadata that encodes the desired properties of the output: for example, prepending [this http URL](http://en.wikipedia.org/) to reduce harmful generations or [this http URL](http://factquizmaster.com/) (fabricated) to improve common knowledge task performance. The study also demonstrates that MeCo is compatible with different types of metadata, such as model-generated topics. MeCo is remarkably simple, adds no computational overhead, and demonstrates promise in producing more capable and steerable language models. <br> <br>

This paper introduces POATE, a jailbreak technique designed to exploit reasoning vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs) through contrastive reasoning. POATE generates prompts with semantically opposing intents and adversarial templates to elicit harmful responses, achieving a higher success rate (~44%) than existing methods. Evaluations on six LLM families, including GPT-4, revealed the limitations of traditional safety defenses against reasoning-based attacks. The authors propose a defense strategy focused on enhancing reasoning robustness using chain-of-thought prompting and reverse thinking to mitigate adversarial exploits.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 3, UKP Lab and Sofia Uni published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01872) “Turning Logic Against Itself : Probing Model Defenses Through Contrastive Questions”. Despite significant efforts to align large language models with human values and ethical guidelines, these models remain susceptible to sophisticated jailbreak attacks that exploit their reasoning capabilities. Traditional safety mechanisms often focus on detecting explicit malicious intent, leaving deeper vulnerabilities unaddressed. This study introduces a jailbreak technique, POATE (Polar Opposite query generation, Adversarial Template construction, and Elaboration), which leverages contrastive reasoning to elicit unethical responses. POATE generates prompts with semantically opposite intents and combines them with adversarial templates to subtly direct models toward producing harmful responses. The authors conduct extensive evaluations across six diverse language model families of varying parameter sizes, including LLaMA3, Gemma2, Phi3, and GPT-4, to demonstrate the robustness of the attack, achieving significantly higher attack success rates (~44%) compared to existing methods. The study evaluates the proposed attack against seven safety defenses, revealing their limitations in addressing reasoning-based vulnerabilities. To counteract this, the authors propose a defense strategy that improves reasoning robustness through chain-of-thought prompting and reverse thinking, mitigating reasoning-driven adversarial exploits. <br> <br>

33. ***Predicting the Performance of Black-box LLMs through Self-Queries <br>
This study develops a method to predict mistakes in black-box LLMs by analyzing response probabilities using self-queries. The extracted low-dimensional features enable the training of linear predictors that outperform white-box predictors based on hidden states. These predictors can identify nuanced model states, such as adversarially influenced versions or architectural differences between models. Applications include detecting misrepresented APIs and evaluating subtle performance changes, offering a practical tool for black-box LLM analysis.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 2, CMU published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01558) “Predicting the Performance of Black-box LLMs through Self-Queries”. As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly relied on in AI systems, predicting when they make mistakes is crucial. While a great deal of work in the field uses internal representations to interpret model behavior, these representations are inaccessible when given solely black-box access through an API. This study extracts features of LLMs in a black-box manner by using follow-up prompts and taking the probabilities of different responses as representations to train reliable predictors of model behavior. The work demonstrates that training a linear model on these low-dimensional representations produces reliable and generalizable predictors of model performance at the instance level (e.g., if a particular generation correctly answers a question). Remarkably, these can often outperform white-box linear predictors that operate over a model's hidden state or the full distribution over its vocabulary. In addition, the study demonstrates that these extracted features can be used to evaluate more nuanced aspects of a language model's state. For instance, they can be used to distinguish between a clean version of GPT-4o-mini and a version that has been influenced via an adversarial system prompt that answers question-answering tasks incorrectly or introduces bugs into generated code. Furthermore, they can reliably distinguish between different model architectures and sizes, enabling the detection of misrepresented models provided through an API (e.g., identifying if GPT-3.5 is supplied instead of GPT-4o-mini). <br> <br>

35. ***Graph Generative Pre-trained Transformer <br>
The study introduces G2PT, an auto-regressive transformer model designed for graph generation. It represents graphs as sequences of node and edge sets for efficient encoding. G2PT excels in generic graph and molecular dataset generation and adapts well to downstream tasks such as goal-oriented generation and graph property prediction. Experiments demonstrate its superior performance and versatility compared to traditional graph generative models*** <br> <br>
    Jan 2, Tufts Uni, Northeastern Uni and Cornell Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01073) “Graph Generative Pre-trained Transformer”. Graph generation is a critical task in numerous domains, including molecular design and social network analysis, due to its ability to model complex relationships and structured data. While most modern graph generative models utilize adjacency matrix representations, this work revisits an alternative approach that represents graphs as sequences of node set and edge set. The study advocates for this approach due to its efficient encoding of graphs and propose a novel representation. Based on this representation, the study introduces the Graph Generative Pre-trained Transformer (G2PT), an auto-regressive model that learns graph structures via next-token prediction. To further exploit G2PT's capabilities as a general-purpose foundation model, the work explores fine-tuning strategies for two downstream applications: goal-oriented generation and graph property prediction. The authors conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets. Results indicate that G2PT achieves superior generative performance on both generic graph and molecule datasets. Furthermore, G2PT exhibits strong adaptability and versatility in downstream tasks from molecular design to property prediction. <br> <br>

37. ***On Program Synthesis and Large Language Models <br>
This article challenges the notion that LLMs will render programming obsolete, citing the inherent computational complexity of program synthesis. While acknowledging the utility of LLMs as programming aids, it underscores the importance of traditional programming skills and formal methods for ensuring program correctness. The piece contextualizes the historical ambition of natural language programming and highlights ongoing challenges in achieving reliable program synthesis through LLMs.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 2, Comm. Of the ACM published a [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3680410) “On Program Synthesis and Large Language Models”. The article examines the assertion that large language models (LLMs) will render programming obsolete. It argues against this claim by highlighting the inherent difficulty of program synthesis, citing theorems proving the computational complexity of generating correct code from specifications. While acknowledging LLMs' potential as programming aids, the author emphasizes their limitations and the continued importance of traditional programming skills and principles. The piece traces the long-held, ultimately unrealized, ambition of using natural language for programming, showing that this is not a new idea, and that existing formal methods for program specification remain important. The core argument centers on the fundamental challenges of ensuring program correctness, a problem that LLMs currently do not solve. <br> <br>

39. ***MAIN-RAG: Multi-Agent Filtering Retrieval-Augmented Generation <br>
MAIN-RAG is a training-free RAG framework that uses multiple LLM agents to collaboratively filter and score retrieved documents. By introducing an adaptive filtering mechanism and leveraging inter-agent consensus, MAIN-RAG reduces noise in retrieved documents and improves response accuracy. Experiments on four QA benchmarks show that MAIN-RAG consistently outperforms traditional RAG methods, enhancing answer accuracy by 2-11% while minimizing irrelevant retrievals. The framework offers a competitive alternative to training-based RAG systems.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 31, Texas A&M Uni, Visa Research, Worcester PloyTechnic Inst, Uni of Utah and Uni of Houston published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00332) “MAIN-RAG: Multi-Agent Filtering Retrieval-Augmented Generation”. Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming essential tools for various natural language processing tasks but often suffer from generating outdated or incorrect information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by incorporating external, real-time information retrieval to ground LLM responses. However, the existing RAG systems frequently struggle with the quality of retrieval documents, as irrelevant or noisy documents degrade performance, increase computational overhead, and undermine response reliability. To tackle this problem, the study proposes Multi-Agent Filtering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MAIN-RAG), a training-free RAG framework that leverages multiple LLM agents to collaboratively filter and score retrieved documents. Specifically, MAIN-RAG introduces an adaptive filtering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the relevance filtering threshold based on score distributions, effectively minimizing noise while maintaining high recall of relevant documents. The proposed approach leverages inter-agent consensus to ensure robust document selection without requiring additional training data or fine-tuning. Experimental results across four QA benchmarks demonstrate that MAIN-RAG consistently outperforms traditional RAG approaches, achieving a 2-11% improvement in answer accuracy while reducing the number of irrelevant retrieved documents. Quantitative analysis further reveals that the approach achieves superior response consistency and answer accuracy over baseline methods, offering a competitive and practical alternative to training-based solutions. <br> <br>

41. ***A Theory of Appropriateness with Applications to Generative Artificial Intelligence <br>
This paper explores the concept of "appropriateness" in human and AI decision-making, presenting a theory that addresses its role in various contexts. The authors analyze how humans adjust behaviors based on situational norms and propose frameworks for implementing similar adaptability in AI systems. The work emphasizes the importance of understanding appropriateness to guide AI development and ensure responsible deployment in diverse applications.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 26, Google, Mila, Uni of Toronto and Max Planck Inst published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19010) “A theory of appropriateness with applications to generative artificial intelligence”. What is appropriateness? Humans navigate a multi-scale mosaic of interlocking notions of what is appropriate for different situations. People act one way with their friends, another with their family, and yet another in the office. Likewise for AI, appropriate behavior for a comedy-writing assistant is not the same as appropriate behavior for a customer-service representative. What determines which actions are appropriate in which contexts? And what causes these standards to change over time? Since all judgments of AI appropriateness are ultimately made by humans, we need to understand how appropriateness guides human decision making in order to properly evaluate AI decision making and improve it. This paper presents a theory of appropriateness: how it functions in human society, how it may be implemented in the brain, and what it means for responsible deployment of generative AI technology.

1. ***Introduction of FlashInfer <br>
FlashInfer is a customizable and efficient attention engine designed for large language models (LLMs), addressing the challenges of scaling with block-sparse formats and Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation for memory optimization and flexibility. Integrated with leading frameworks, it significantly improves inference performance, reducing inter-token latency by 29-69%, long-context latency by 28-30%, and achieving 13-17% speedup in parallel generation.*** <br> <br>
   Jan 2, Nvidia, Uni of Washington, Perplexity AI, and CMU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01005) “FlashInfer: Efficient and Customizable Attention Engine for LLM Inference Serving”. Transformers, driven by attention mechanisms, form the foundation of large language models (LLMs). As these models scale up, efficient GPU attention kernels become essential for high-throughput and low-latency inference. Diverse LLM applications demand flexible and high-performance attention solutions. The study presents FlashInfer: a customizable and efficient attention engine for LLM serving. FlashInfer tackles KV-cache storage heterogeneity using block-sparse format and composable formats to optimize memory access and reduce redundancy. It also offers a customizable attention template, enabling adaptation to various settings through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. Additionally, FlashInfer's load-balanced scheduling algorithm adjusts to dynamism of user requests while maintaining compatibility with CUDAGraph which requires static configuration. FlashInfer have been integrated into leading LLM serving frameworks like SGLang, vLLM and MLC-Engine. Comprehensive kernel-level and end-to-end evaluations demonstrate FlashInfer's ability to significantly boost kernel performance across diverse inference scenarios: compared to state-of-the-art LLM serving solutions, FlashInfer achieve 29-69% inter-token-latency reduction compared to compiler backends for LLM serving benchmark, 28-30% latency reduction for long-context inference, and 13-17% speedup for LLM serving with parallel generation. <br> <br>

3. ***Launch of MEDEC <br>
MEDEC is the first benchmark designed to evaluate medical error detection and correction in clinical notes, combining medical knowledge and reasoning. Tested with models like GPT-4 and Claude, it proves challenging while revealing model sizes of OpenAI’s LLMs. MEDEC facilitates validation of medical text accuracy and establishes a foundation for advancing error detection technologies.*** <br> <br>
   Jan 2, Microsoft and Uni of Washington published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19260) “MEDEC: A Benchmark for Medical Error Detection and Correction in Clinical Notes”. Several studies showed that Large Language Models (LLMs) can answer medical questions correctly, even outperforming the average human score in some medical exams. However, to our knowledge, no study has been conducted to assess the ability of language models to validate existing or generated medical text for correctness and consistency. The paper introduces MEDEC (this https URL), the first publicly available benchmark for medical error detection and correction in clinical notes. The dataset has been used for the MEDIQA-CORR shared task to evaluate seventeen participating systems. The paper describes the data creation methods and evaluates recent LLMs (e.g., o1-preview, GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for the tasks of detecting and correcting medical errors requiring both medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities. The results showed that MEDEC is a sufficiently challenging benchmark to assess the ability of models to validate existing or generated notes and to correct medical errors. What is of interesting is that the paper seems leaking the size of OpenAI’s LLMs, that is, gpt-4o (~200B), GPT-4o-mini 2024-05-13 (~8B), o1-mini-2024-09-12 (~100B), and o1-preview-2024-09-12 (~300B). <br> <br>

5. ***Addressing Cultural Representation <br>
Google’s study explores the risks of cultural erasure by LLMs in societal knowledge production. It identifies two forms of cultural loss—omission and simplification—and emphasizes developing benchmarks for cross-cultural impacts. Focused on cultural representations in descriptions and travel recommendations, the study advocates for sociological awareness and equitable global cultural inclusion.*** <br> <br>
   Jan 2, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01056) “Risks of Cultural Erasure in Large Language Models”. Large language models are increasingly being integrated into applications that shape the production and discovery of societal knowledge such as search, online education, and travel planning. As a result, language models will shape how people learn about, perceive and interact with global cultures making it important to consider whose knowledge systems and perspectives are represented in models. Recognizing this importance, increasingly work in Machine Learning and NLP has focused on evaluating gaps in global cultural representational distribution within outputs. However, more work is needed on developing benchmarks for cross-cultural impacts of language models that stem from a nuanced sociologically-aware conceptualization of cultural impact or harm. The study joins this line of work arguing for the need of metricizable evaluations of language technologies that interrogate and account for historical power inequities and differential impacts of representation on global cultures, particularly for cultures already under-represented in the digital corpora. The study looks at two concepts of erasure: omission: where cultures are not represented at all and simplification i.e. when cultural complexity is erased by presenting one-dimensional views of a rich culture. The former focuses on whether something is represented, and the latter on how it is represented. The study focuses the analysis on two task contexts with the potential to influence global cultural production. First, the work probes representations that a language model produces about different places around the world when asked to describe these contexts. Second, the study analyzes the cultures represented in the travel recommendations produced by a set of language model applications. The study shows ways in which the NLP community and application developers can begin to operationalize complex socio-cultural considerations into standard evaluations and benchmarks. <br> <br>

7. ***Multi-Dimensional Data Storytelling (MDSF) Framework for Data Insights <br>
The MDSF framework leverages LLMs for automated, context-aware data storytelling. With fine-tuned models, advanced preprocessing, and scoring mechanisms, MDSF generates actionable insights with minimal bias. It outperforms existing methods in insight ranking, coherence, and descriptive quality, showcasing its potential in automating complex analytical tasks and enhancing user satisfaction.*** <br> <br>
   Jan 2, Xiaomi published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01014) “MDSF: Context-Aware Multi-Dimensional Data Storytelling Framework based on Large language Model”. The exponential growth of data and advancements in big data technologies have created a demand for more efficient and automated approaches to data analysis and storytelling. However, automated data analysis systems still face challenges in leveraging large language models (LLMs) for data insight discovery, augmented analysis, and data storytelling. This paper introduces the Multidimensional Data Storytelling Framework (MDSF) based on large language models for automated insight generation and context-aware storytelling. The framework incorporates advanced preprocessing techniques, augmented analysis algorithms, and a unique scoring mechanism to identify and prioritize actionable insights. The use of fine-tuned LLMs enhances contextual understanding and generates narratives with minimal manual intervention. The architecture also includes an agent-based mechanism for real-time storytelling continuation control. Key findings reveal that MDSF outperforms existing methods across various datasets in terms of insight ranking accuracy, descriptive quality, and narrative coherence. The experimental evaluation demonstrates MDSF's ability to automate complex analytical tasks, reduce interpretive biases, and improve user satisfaction. User studies further underscore its practical utility in enhancing content structure, conclusion extraction, and richness of detail. <br> <br>

9. ***Solving Arithmetic Reliably <br>
The Integrated Gated Calculator (IGC) enables LLMs to solve arithmetic tasks efficiently and accurately, achieving near-perfect results on benchmarks like BigBench Arithmetic. Integrated seamlessly into models, it avoids intermediate tokens and side effects, representing a major advancement in computational efficiency for arithmetic tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Jan 1, Saarland Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00684) “IGC: Integrating a Gated Calculator into an LLM to Solve Arithmetic Tasks Reliably and Efficiently”. Solving arithmetic tasks is a simple and fundamental skill, yet modern Large Language Models (LLMs) have great difficulty with them. The study introduces the Integrated Gated Calculator (IGC), a module that enables LLMs to perform arithmetic by emulating a calculator on the GPU. The study finetunes a Llama model with the module and test it on the BigBench Arithmetic benchmark, where it beats the State of the Art, outperforming all models on the benchmark, including models almost two orders of magnitude larger. The approach takes only a single iteration to run and requires no external tools. It performs arithmetic operations entirely inside the LLM without the need to produce intermediate tokens. It is computationally efficient, interpretable, and avoids side-effects on tasks that do not require arithmetic operations. It reliably achieves 98\% to 99\% accuracy across multiple training runs and for all subtasks, including the substantially harder subtask of multiplication, which was previously unsolved. <br> <br>

11. ***Titans: Balancing Memory and Attention <br>
The Titans architecture combines short-term attention and long-term neural memory for efficient processing of historical and current context. Capable of handling over 2M context windows, Titans outperform traditional transformers in tasks like language modeling and genomics, offering a scalable and effective solution for complex data dependencies.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 31, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00663) “Titans: Learning to Memorize at Test Time”. Over more than a decade there has been an extensive research effort on how to effectively utilize recurrent models and attention. While recurrent models aim to compress the data into a fixed-size memory (called hidden state), attention allows attending to the entire context window, capturing the direct dependencies of all tokens. This more accurate modeling of dependencies, however, comes with a quadratic cost, limiting the model to a fixed-length context. The study presents a new neural long-term memory module that learns to memorize historical context and helps attention to attend to the current context while utilizing long past information. The work shows that this neural memory has the advantage of fast parallelizable training while maintaining a fast inference. From a memory perspective, the authors argue that attention due to its limited context but accurate dependency modeling performs as a short-term memory, while neural memory due to its ability to memorize the data, acts as a long-term, more persistent, memory. Based on these two modules, the study introduces a new family of architectures, called Titans, and present three variants to address how one can effectively incorporate memory into this architecture. Experimental results on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, genomics, and time series tasks show that Titans are more effective than Transformers and recent modern linear recurrent models. They further can effectively scale to larger than 2M context window size with higher accuracy in needle-in-haystack tasks compared to baselines. <br> <br>

13. ***Aviary for Scientific Challenges <br>
Aviary introduces a framework for training language agents to tackle complex scientific tasks, using environments like molecular cloning and protein engineering. It demonstrates that open-source LLMs can outperform larger models in scientific reasoning tasks at a fraction of the cost, fostering advancements in automated scientific research.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 30, FutureHouse Inc, Uni of Rochester and Francis Crick Inst published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21154) “Aviary: training language agents on challenging scientific tasks”. Solving complex real-world tasks requires cycles of actions and observations. This is particularly true in science, where tasks require many cycles of analysis, tool use, and experimentation. Language agents are promising for automating intellectual tasks in science because they can interact with tools via natural language or code. Yet their flexibility creates conceptual and practical challenges for software implementations, since agents may comprise non-standard components such as internal reasoning, planning, tool usage, as well as the inherent stochasticity of temperature-sampled language models. Here, the study introduces Aviary, an extensible gymnasium for language agents. The work formalizes agents as policies solving language-grounded partially observable Markov decision processes, which is termed as language decision processes. The study then implements five environments, including three challenging scientific environments: (1) manipulating DNA constructs for molecular cloning, (2) answering research questions by accessing scientific literature, and (3) engineering protein stability. These environments were selected for their focus on multi-step reasoning and their relevance to contemporary biology research. Finally, with online training and scaling inference-time compute, the study shows that language agents backed by open-source, non-frontier LLMs can match and exceed both frontier LLM agents and human experts on multiple tasks at up to 100x lower inference cost. <br> <br>

15. ***Training SWE Agents in Real-World Tasks <br>
SWE-Gym is the first environment tailored for software engineering agents, featuring real-world Python tasks and runtime environments. Achieving state-of-the-art performance, SWE-Gym facilitates training and evaluation of SWE agents, setting new benchmarks for code understanding and task resolution efficiency.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 30, UC Berkeley, UIUC, CMU and Apple published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21139) “Training Software Engineering Agents and Verifiers with SWE-Gym”. The study presents SWE-Gym, the first environment for training real-world software engineering (SWE) agents. SWE-Gym contains 2,438 real-world Python task instances, each comprising a codebase with an executable runtime environment, unit tests, and a task specified in natural language. The study uses SWE-Gym to train language model based SWE agents , achieving up to 19% absolute gains in resolve rate on the popular SWE-Bench Verified and Lite test sets. The study also experiments with inference-time scaling through verifiers trained on agent trajectories sampled from SWE-Gym. When combined with the fine-tuned SWE agents, the work achieves 32.0% and 26.0% on SWE-Bench Verified and Lite, respectively, reflecting a new state-of-the-art for open-weight SWE agents. To facilitate further research, the authors publicly release SWE-Gym, models, and agent trajectories. <br> <br>

17. ***Adapting LLMs for Multimodal Tasks <br>
LMFusion extends text-only LLMs to multimodal capabilities by introducing vision-specific modules. It improves image understanding and generation while maintaining language capabilities, using only half the computational cost of multimodal pretraining, thus advancing efficient multimodal AI development.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 30, Uni of Washington, Meta and Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15188) “LMFusion: Adapting Pretrained Language Models for Multimodal Generation”. The work presents LMFusion, a framework for empowering pretrained text-only large language models (LLMs) with multimodal generative capabilities, enabling them to understand and generate both text and images in arbitrary sequences. LMFusion leverages existing Llama-3's weights for processing texts autoregressively while introducing additional and parallel transformer modules for processing images with diffusion. During training, the data from each modality is routed to its dedicated modules: modality-specific feedforward layers, query-key-value projections, and normalization layers process each modality independently, while the shared self-attention layers allow interactions across text and image features. By freezing the text-specific modules and only training the image-specific modules, LMFusion preserves the language capabilities of text-only LLMs while developing strong visual understanding and generation abilities. Compared to methods that pretrain multimodal generative models from scratch, experiments demonstrate that, LMFusion improves image understanding by 20% and image generation by 3.6% using only 50% of the FLOPs while maintaining Llama-3's language capabilities. The study also demonstrates that this framework can adapt existing vision-language models with multimodal generation ability. Overall, this framework not only leverages existing computational investments in text-only LLMs but also enables the parallel development of language and vision capabilities, presenting a promising direction for efficient multimodal model development. <br> <br>

19. ***Implications of Labor-Substituting AI <br>
The article discusses the societal shifts resulting from labor-replacing AI, such as reduced human agency and entrenched power imbalances. While universal basic income addresses unemployment, broader solutions are required to preserve human ambition and societal dynamism in an AI-driven world.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 29, No Set Gaue published an [article](https://nosetgauge.substack.com/p/capital-agi-and-human-ambition) “Capital, AGI, and human ambition”. The article presents a thought-provoking analysis of the potential societal impacts of labor-replacing AI, emphasizing the significant shift in power dynamics it could usher in. The author argues that as AI increasingly substitutes human labor, the ability of money to buy results in the real world will dramatically increase, while the power and leverage derived from human labor will diminish significantly. This shift will have profound implications for human ambition and societal dynamism, as outlier success through labor in entrepreneurship, science, intellectual spheres, and even politics might become increasingly difficult. The author also raises concerns about the potential erosion of incentives for states to care about human welfare in a post-labor-replacing AI world. While universal basic income (UBI) is often presented as a solution to AI-driven unemployment, the article argues that it might not address the deeper issue of human agency and purpose in a society where human labor holds little value. Moreover, the article suggests that radical equalizing measures are unlikely, potentially leading to a further entrenchment of existing power imbalances within and between countries. The author concludes by calling for a focus on preserving human ambition and societal dynamism in the face of advancing AI, advocating for a more nuanced approach that recognizes the potential for both transformative opportunities and significant risks. Instead of viewing the rise of AI as an inevitable march towards human obsolescence, the author urges readers to consider the potential "cracks in the wall" that might allow human agency and ambition to thrive even in a world dominated by AI. <br> <br>

21. ***Google’s 2025 AI Priorities <br>
Sundar Pichai emphasizes urgency in AI innovation, focusing on scaling Gemini and launching new AI products. Despite legal and competitive pressures, breakthroughs like the quantum chip Willow underscore Google’s commitment to advancing AI and quantum technologies.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 29, according to [Yahoo!Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-ceo-urges-employees-move-181001093.html), Google CEO Sundar Pichai emphasized the urgency and need for speed as the company prepares for a pivotal year in 2025, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI). At a strategy meeting on December 18, Pichai urged employees to "stay scrappy" amidst competitive and regulatory challenges, highlighting the importance of AI in solving real user problems. He acknowledged the mounting legal scrutiny following an antitrust case loss and stressed the need to remain focused despite these pressures. Pichai outlined the priority of building new businesses, including scaling the AI-powered Gemini app, which has shown strong momentum. Demis Hassabis of DeepMind mentioned that Gemini will see significant advancements in the coming years. Additionally, Google Labs showcased new AI products, including a coding assistant and an AI-powered Chrome extension. Despite competition from rivals like OpenAI, Google's VP of Search, Liz Reid, remained optimistic, emphasizing the potential of AI to make search more effortless and accessible. Google also announced a breakthrough in quantum computing with its new quantum chip, Willow, which outperformed the world's best supercomputer, signaling significant progress in the field. <br> <br>

23. ***MACT for Table Question Answering <br>
MACT employs planning and coding agents with tool use to answer complex table-based questions. Without relying on closed-source or fine-tuned models, it achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks, demonstrating effective multi-agent collaboration.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 28, Bosch Center for AI, Uni of Augsburg and Hochschule der Medien published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20145v1) “Efficient Multi-Agent Collaboration with Tool Use for Online Planning in Complex Table Question Answering”. Complex table question answering (TQA) aims to answer questions that require complex reasoning, such as multi-step or multi-category reasoning, over data represented in tabular form. Previous approaches demonstrated notable performance by leveraging either closed-source large language models (LLMs) or fine-tuned open-weight LLMs. However, fine-tuning LLMs requires high-quality training data, which is costly to obtain, and utilizing closed-source LLMs poses accessibility challenges and leads to reproducibility issues. This study proposes Multi-Agent Collaboration with Tool use (MACT), a framework that requires neither closed-source models nor fine-tuning. In MACT, a planning agent and a coding agent that also make use of tools collaborate to answer questions. Experiments on four TQA benchmarks show that MACT outperforms previous SoTA systems on three out of four benchmarks and that it performs comparably to the larger and more expensive closed-source model GPT-4 on two benchmarks, even when using only open-weight models without any fine-tuning. The authors conduct extensive analyses to prove the effectiveness of MACT's multi-agent collaboration in TQA. <br> <br>

25. ***TeLU for Fast and Stable Learning <br>
The TeLU activation function combines simplicity with computational efficiency, mitigating the vanishing gradient problem while enhancing convergence. Validated through experiments, TeLU sets a new standard in neural network activation, driving advancements in scalability and robustness.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 28, Uni of South Florida published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20269) “TeLU Activation Function for Fast and Stable Deep Learning”. The work proposes the Hyperbolic Tangent Exponential Linear Unit (TeLU), a neural network hidden activation function defined as TeLU(x)=xtanh(exp(x)). TeLU's design is grounded in the core principles of key activation functions, achieving strong convergence by closely approximating the identity function in its active region while effectively mitigating the vanishing gradient problem in its saturating region. Its simple formulation enhances computational efficiency, leading to improvements in scalability and convergence speed. Unlike many modern activation functions, TeLU seamlessly combines the simplicity and effectiveness of ReLU with the smoothness and analytic properties essential for learning stability in deep neural networks. TeLU's ability to mimic the behavior and optimal hyperparameter settings of ReLU, while introducing the benefits of smoothness and curvature, makes it an ideal drop-in replacement. Its analytic nature positions TeLU as a powerful universal approximator, enhancing both robustness and generalization across a multitude of experiments. The study rigorously validates these claims through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, demonstrating TeLU's performance across challenging benchmarks; including ResNet18 on ImageNet, Dynamic-Pooling Transformers on Text8, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) on the Penn TreeBank dataset. These results highlight TeLU's potential to set a new standard in activation functions, driving more efficient and stable learning in deep neural networks, thereby accelerating scientific discoveries across various fields. <br> <br>

27. ***Inference-Aware Alignment Framework <br>
InfAlign introduces a KL-regularized calibration framework for language model alignment, optimizing inference-time decoding strategies. Tailored to methods like best-of-N sampling, it achieves superior alignment and inference-time win rates over existing baselines, enhancing model performance and utility.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 27, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19792) “InfAlign: Inference-aware language model alignment”. Language model alignment has become a critical step in training modern generative language models. The goal of alignment is to finetune a reference model such that the win rate of a sample from the aligned model over a sample from the reference model is high, subject to a KL divergence constraint. Today, people are increasingly using inference-time algorithms (e.g., Best-of-N, controlled decoding, tree search) to decode from language models rather than standard sampling. However, the alignment objective does not capture such inference-time decoding procedures. The study shows that the existing alignment framework is sub-optimal in view of such inference-time methods. The study then modifies the alignment objective and propose a framework for inference-aware alignment (IAPO). The work proves that for any inference-time decoding algorithm, the optimal solution that optimizes the inference-time win rate of the aligned policy against the reference policy is the solution to the typical RLHF problem with a transformation of the reward. This motivates the authors to provide the KL-regularized calibrate-and-transform RL (CTRL) algorithm to solve this problem, which involves a reward calibration step and a KL-regularized reward maximization step with a transformation of the calibrated reward. The work particularizes the study to two important inference-time strategies: best-of-N sampling and best-of-N jailbreaking, where N responses are sampled from the model and the one with the highest or lowest reward is selected. The study proposes specific transformations for these strategies and demonstrate that the framework offers significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods for language model alignment. Empirically, the models outperform baselines that are designed without taking inference-time decoding into consideration by 8-12% and 4-9% on inference-time win rates over the Anthropic helpfulness and harmlessness dialog benchmark datasets. <br> <br>

29. ***Adaptation of Complex Skills <br>
Dynamic Skill Adaptation (DSA) presents a flexible framework for incorporating novel skills into LLMs. By adapting skills dynamically, DSA enhances model performance across varied and complex tasks, ensuring better alignment with evolving requirements.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 26, Georgia Inst of Tech and Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19361) “Dynamic Skill Adaptation for Large Language Models”. The study presents Dynamic Skill Adaptation (DSA), an adaptive and dynamic framework to adapt novel and complex skills to Large Language Models (LLMs). Compared with previous work which learns from human-curated and static data in random orders, the study proposes to first automatically generate and organize the training data by mimicking the learning pathways of human and then dynamically tailor the training data based on the training dynamics. Specifically, inspired by the learning structures and teaching strategies in the human education system, the study first constructs a skill graph by decomposing complex skills into sub-skills and arranging them based on their dependencies in human syllables. For every skill, the study utilizes LLMs to generate both textbook-like data which contains detailed descriptions of skills for pre-training and exercise-like data which targets at explicitly utilizing the skills to solve problems for instruction-tuning. Furthermore, during the instruction-tuning, the study dynamically updates the training data which down-weight easy-to-learn examples, generate more complex examples, and filter out data with errors. Experiments on large language models such as LLAMA and Mistral demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in adapting math reasoning skills and social study skills. <br> <br>

31. ***PRISM: Incremental Reasoning with Structured Memories <br>
The University of Oxford and Google introduced PRISM, a novel method for long-range tasks requiring reasoning over extensive inputs. PRISM processes information in small chunks using a structured memory defined by a typed hierarchy schema. This token-efficient method significantly reduces costs (up to 54%) compared to traditional long-context approaches and maintains high-quality performance using contexts as small as 500 tokens. The schema generalization enables effortless adaptation to new tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 25, Uni of Oxford and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18914) “Long-Range Tasks Using Short-Context LLMs: Incremental Reasoning With Structured Memories”. Long-range tasks require reasoning over long inputs. Existing solutions either need large compute budgets, training data, access to model weights, or use complex, task-specific approaches. The study presents PRISM, which alleviates these concerns by processing information as a stream of chunks, maintaining a structured in-context memory specified by a typed hierarchy schema. This approach demonstrates superior performance to baselines on diverse tasks while using at least 4x smaller contexts than long-context models. Moreover, PRISM is token-efficient. By producing short outputs and efficiently leveraging key-value (KV) caches, it achieves up to 54% cost reduction when compared to alternative short-context approaches. The method also scales down to tiny information chunks (e.g., 500 tokens) without increasing the number of tokens encoded or sacrificing quality. Furthermore, the study shows that it is possible to generate schemas to generalize the approach to new tasks with minimal effort. <br> <br>

37. ***CypherBench: Modern Knowledge Graph Retrieval <br>
Megagon Labs and Politecnico di Torno proposed CypherBench to enhance knowledge graph retrieval for LLMs. The study highlighted inefficiencies in RDF-based graphs like Wikidata for LLMs due to schema size and complexity. They suggested property graph views queried using Cypher, leading to the creation of a benchmark with 7.8 million entities and 10,000+ questions. Innovations included an RDF-to-property graph conversion engine and new evaluation metrics.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 24, Megagon Labs and Politecnico di Torno published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18702) “CypherBench: Towards Precise Retrieval over Full-scale Modern Knowledge Graphs in the LLM Era”. Retrieval from graph data is crucial for augmenting large language models (LLM) with both open-domain knowledge and private enterprise data, and it is also a key component in the recent GraphRAG system. Despite decades of research on knowledge graphs and knowledge base question answering, leading LLM frameworks (e.g. Langchain and LlamaIndex) have only minimal support for retrieval from modern encyclopedic knowledge graphs like Wikidata. This study analyzes the root cause and suggest that modern RDF knowledge graphs (e.g. Wikidata, Freebase) are less efficient for LLMs due to overly large schemas that far exceed the typical LLM context window, use of resource identifiers, overlapping relation types and lack of normalization. As a solution, the study proposes property graph views on top of the underlying RDF graph that can be efficiently queried by LLMs using Cypher. The work instantiated this idea on Wikidata and introduced CypherBench, the first benchmark with 11 large-scale, multi-domain property graphs with 7.8 million entities and over 10,000 questions. To achieve this, the authors tackled several key challenges, including developing an RDF-to-property graph conversion engine, creating a systematic pipeline for text-to-Cypher task generation, and designing new evaluation metrics. <br> <br>

39. ***SWAN: Stateless LLM Training <br>
Microsoft introduced SWAN (SGD with Whitening And Normalization), a stateless optimizer for LLM training. Unlike memory-intensive adaptive optimizers like Adam, SWAN preprocesses stochastic gradients using normalization and whitening, achieving Adam-level performance with ≈50% memory reduction. Empirical results showed SWAN delivering 2x training speedup, making it a cost-effective and scalable solution for large models like LLaMA (350M and 1.3B parameters).*** <br> <br>
    Dec 23, Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13148) “SWAN: SGD with Normalization and Whitening Enables Stateless LLM Training”. Adaptive optimizers such as Adam have been central to the success of large language models. However, they often require to maintain optimizer states throughout training, which can result in memory requirements several times greater than the model footprint. This overhead imposes constraints on scalability and computational efficiency. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), in contrast, is a stateless optimizer, as it does not track state variables during training. Consequently, it achieves optimal memory efficiency. However, its capability in LLM training is limited. This study shows that pre-processing SGD in a stateless manner can achieve the same performance as the Adam optimizer for LLM training, while drastically reducing the memory cost. Specifically, the study proposes to pre-process the instantaneous stochastic gradients using normalization and whitening. The work shows that normalization stabilizes gradient distributions, and whitening counteracts the local curvature of the loss landscape. This results in SWAN (SGD with Whitening And Normalization), a stochastic optimizer that eliminates the need to store any optimizer states. Empirically, SWAN has the same memory footprint as SGD, achieving ≈50% reduction on total end-to-end memory compared to Adam. In language modeling tasks, SWAN demonstrates comparable or even better performance than Adam: when pre-training the LLaMA model with 350M and 1.3B parameters, SWAN achieves a 2x speedup by reaching the same evaluation perplexity using half as many tokens.

1. ***OpenAI's Shift to a Traditional For-Profit Structure:  <br>OpenAI plans to transition to a traditional for-profit structure in 2025 to attract more investment, moving away from its complex nonprofit-for-profit hybrid model. The new structure will likely be a public benefit corporation, ensuring a balance between profit generation and societal benefit. This change aims to simplify fundraising efforts and support OpenAI's long-term goals, including achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI), while staying competitive against rivals like Meta and Anthropic.*** <br> <br>
   Dec 27, according to [fortune](https://fortune.com/2024/12/27/openai-for-profit-non-profit-company-investors/), OpenAI has announced plans to transition to a more traditional for-profit company structure in 2025 to attract more investor funding. Currently, a nonprofit controls a for-profit arm, which in turn controls a holding company that oversees another for-profit entity. This complex structure has hindered fundraising efforts. The new entity will likely be a public benefit corporation, which aims to generate profit while also providing a public benefit. The nonprofit will continue to exist but will no longer have a controlling role. OpenAI's current structure, established in 2019, is seen as a disadvantage in the competitive AI market, especially against rivals like Meta and Anthropic. Despite raising $6.6 billion recently, OpenAI needs more capital to support its growth and ambitions, including achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). The company acknowledges that to secure the necessary funding, it must offer conventional equity and reduce structural complexities. OpenAI aims to evolve into an enduring company that contributes to building the AGI economy and ensuring its benefits for humanity. <br> <br>

3. ***Meta's Approach to Improving Factuality in Text Generation:  <br>Meta introduces the "Explicit Working Memory" (EWE) method to improve the factuality of large language models (LLMs). EWE integrates real-time feedback from external resources, refreshing memory to rectify inaccuracies during generation. Experiments show that EWE enhances factuality without sacrificing helpfulness, outperforming existing models on key datasets by improving factuality scores and demonstrating the importance of memory updates and retrieval quality.*** <br> <br>
   Dec 24, Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18069) “Improving Factuality with Explicit Working Memory”. Large language models can generate factually inaccurate content, a problem known as hallucination. Recent works have built upon retrieved-augmented generation to improve factuality through iterative prompting but these methods are limited by the traditional RAG design. To address these challenges, the study introduces EWE (Explicit Working Memory), a novel approach that enhances factuality in long-form text generation by integrating a working memory that receives real-time feedback from external resources. The memory is refreshed based on online fact-checking and retrieval feedback, allowing EWE to rectify false claims during the generation process and ensure more accurate and reliable outputs. Experiments demonstrate that Ewe outperforms strong baselines on four fact-seeking long-form generation datasets, increasing the factuality metric, VeriScore, by 2 to 10 points absolute without sacrificing the helpfulness of the responses. Further analysis reveals that the design of rules for memory updates, configurations of memory units, and the quality of the retrieval datastore are crucial factors for influencing model performance. <br> <br>

5. ***Advancing Artificial Life with Foundation Models:  <br>A collaboration between MIT, OpenAI, and others presents a method for automating the search for artificial life (ALife) using foundation models (FMs). The paper introduces "Automated Search for Artificial Life" (ASAL), which uses FMs to explore large combinatorial spaces and generate novel ALife simulations. The approach reveals new lifeforms and opens new avenues in ALife research by using FMs to quantify phenomena previously viewed qualitatively.*** <br> <br>
   Dec 23, MIT, Sakana AI, OpenAI and others published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17799) “Automating the Search for Artificial Life with Foundation Models”. With the recent Nobel Prize awarded for radical advances in protein discovery, foundation models (FMs) for exploring large combinatorial spaces promise to revolutionize many scientific fields. Artificial Life (ALife) has not yet integrated FMs, thus presenting a major opportunity for the field to alleviate the historical burden of relying chiefly on manual design and trial-and-error to discover the configurations of lifelike simulations. This paper presents, for the first time, a successful realization of this opportunity using vision-language FMs. The proposed approach, called Automated Search for Artificial Life (ASAL), (1) finds simulations that produce target phenomena, (2) discovers simulations that generate temporally open-ended novelty, and (3) illuminates an entire space of interestingly diverse simulations. Because of the generality of FMs, ASAL works effectively across a diverse range of ALife substrates including Boids, Particle Life, Game of Life, Lenia, and Neural Cellular Automata. A major result highlighting the potential of this technique is the discovery of previously unseen Lenia and Boids lifeforms, as well as cellular automata that are open-ended like Conway's Game of Life. Additionally, the use of FMs allows for the quantification of previously qualitative phenomena in a human-aligned way. This new paradigm promises to accelerate ALife research beyond what is possible through human ingenuity alone. <br> <br>

7. ***ResearchTown Simulates Human Research Communities:  <br>A study from UIUC introduces ResearchTown, a multi-agent framework that simulates human research communities, leveraging LLMs to model collaborative activities such as paper writing and reviewing. The framework uses TextGNN for research simulations and ResearchBench for evaluating the simulation's realism. Results show that ResearchTown can generate interdisciplinary research ideas and provide a robust model of research community dynamics.*** <br> <br>
   Dec 23, UIUC published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17767) “ResearchTown: Simulator of Human Research Community”. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in scientific domains, yet a fundamental question remains unanswered: Can we simulate human research communities with LLMs? Addressing this question can deepen our understanding of the processes behind idea brainstorming and inspire the automatic discovery of novel scientific insights. This study proposes ResearchTown, a multi-agent framework for research community simulation. Within this framework, the human research community is simplified and modeled as an agent-data graph, where researchers and papers are represented as agent-type and data-type nodes, respectively, and connected based on their collaboration relationships. The study also introduces TextGNN, a text-based inference framework that models various research activities (e.g., paper reading, paper writing, and review writing) as special forms of a unified message-passing process on the agent-data graph. To evaluate the quality of the research simulation, the work presents ResearchBench, a benchmark that uses a node-masking prediction task for scalable and objective assessment based on similarity. Experiments reveal three key findings: (1) ResearchTown can provide a realistic simulation of collaborative research activities, including paper writing and review writing; (2) ResearchTown can maintain robust simulation with multiple researchers and diverse papers; (3) ResearchTown can generate interdisciplinary research ideas that potentially inspire novel research directions. <br> <br>

9. ***Google’s Differentiable Cache Augmentation for LLMs:  <br>Google’s research demonstrates how a frozen large language model (LLM) can be enhanced by an offline coprocessor that augments the model's key-value (kv) cache. This technique improves the model’s reasoning abilities by refining its cache with latent embeddings, enhancing subsequent decoding tasks. The approach improves performance across reasoning-intensive tasks without requiring task-specific training, showcasing a novel and efficient method for optimizing LLMs.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 23, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17747) “Deliberation in Latent Space via Differentiable Cache Augmentation”. Techniques enabling large language models (LLMs) to "think more" by generating and attending to intermediate reasoning steps have shown promise in solving complex problems. However, the standard approaches generate sequences of discrete tokens immediately before responding, and so they can incur significant latency costs and be challenging to optimize. This study demonstrates that a frozen LLM can be augmented with an offline coprocessor that operates on the model's key-value (kv) cache. This coprocessor augments the cache with a set of latent embeddings designed to improve the fidelity of subsequent decoding. The study trains this coprocessor using the language modeling loss from the decoder on standard pretraining data, while keeping the decoder itself frozen. This approach enables the model to learn, in an end-to-end differentiable fashion, how to distill additional computation into its kv-cache. Because the decoder remains unchanged, the coprocessor can operate offline and asynchronously, and the language model can function normally if the coprocessor is unavailable or if a given cache is deemed not to require extra computation. The study shows experimentally that when a cache is augmented, the decoder achieves lower perplexity on numerous subsequent tokens. Furthermore, even without any task-specific training, experiments demonstrate that cache augmentation consistently reduces perplexity and improves performance across a range of reasoning-intensive tasks. <br> <br>

11. ***OpenAI's o1 Model Focuses on Safety and Robustness:  <br>OpenAI's o1 system card outlines the capabilities of the o1 and o1-mini models, which utilize chain-of-thought reasoning to improve safety and robustness. These models offer state-of-the-art performance in addressing risks like generating illicit advice and avoiding stereotypes. The card emphasizes the importance of robust alignment methods and extensive safety evaluations to balance the benefits of enhanced intelligence with potential risks.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 22, OpenAI released it o1 [system card](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16720) “OpenAI o1 System Card”. The o1 model series is trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to reason using chain of thought. These advanced reasoning capabilities provide new avenues for improving the safety and robustness of the models. In particular, the models can reason about the safety policies in context when responding to potentially unsafe prompts, through deliberative alignment. This leads to state-of-the-art performance on certain benchmarks for risks such as generating illicit advice, choosing stereotyped responses, and succumbing to known jailbreaks. Training models to incorporate a chain of thought before answering has the potential to unlock substantial benefits, while also increasing potential risks that stem from heightened intelligence. The results underscore the need for building robust alignment methods, extensively stress-testing their efficacy, and maintaining meticulous risk management protocols. This report outlines the safety work carried out for the OpenAI o1 and OpenAI o1-mini models, including safety evaluations, external red teaming, and Preparedness Framework evaluations. <br> <br>

13. ***Persuasion and Deception in LLMs:  <br>A paper from UC San Diego explores the persuasive and deceptive capabilities of LLMs, highlighting their potential for generating convincing, yet false content. The review examines recent studies on LLMs' persuasive effects and deceptive outputs, analyzing theoretical risks and evaluating possible mitigation strategies. The paper also presents key open questions about the future impact of AI-driven persuasion and truthfulness in AI-generated content.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 22, Uni of California San Diego published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17128) “Lies, Damned Lies, and Distributional Language Statistics Persuasion and Deception with Large Language Models”. Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate content that is as persuasive as human-written text and appear capable of selectively producing deceptive outputs. These capabilities raise concerns about potential misuse and unintended consequences as these systems become more widely deployed. This review synthesizes recent empirical work examining LLMs' capacity and proclivity for persuasion and deception, analyzes theoretical risks that could arise from these capabilities, and evaluates proposed mitigations. While current persuasive effects are relatively small, various mechanisms could increase their impact, including fine-tuning, multimodality, and social factors. The authors outline key open questions for future research, including how persuasive AI systems might become, whether truth enjoys an inherent advantage over falsehoods, and how effective different mitigation strategies may be in practice. <br> <br>

15. ***Google’s LearnLM for Educational AI:  <br>Google's LearnLM study focuses on improving generative AI for educational purposes by introducing pedagogical instruction following in LLMs. The approach helps customize AI behavior to meet specific pedagogical goals, allowing models like Gemini to perform better in learning scenarios. Results show that LearnLM outperforms other models like GPT-4 and Claude in expert evaluations, paving the way for more effective AI tutors.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 21, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16429) “LearnLM Improving Gemini for Learning”. Today's generative AI systems are tuned to present information by default rather than engage users in service of learning as a human tutor would. To address the wide range of potential education use cases for these systems, the study reframes the challenge of injecting pedagogical behavior as one of pedagogical instruction following, where training and evaluation examples include system-level instructions describing the specific pedagogy attributes present or desired in subsequent model turns. This framing avoids committing the models to any particular definition of pedagogy, and instead allows teachers or developers to specify desired model behavior. It also clears a path to improving Gemini models for learning -- by enabling the addition of the pedagogical data to post-training mixtures -- alongside their rapidly expanding set of capabilities. Both represent important changes from the initial tech report. The study shows how training with pedagogical instruction following produces a LearnLM model (available on Google AI Studio) that is preferred substantially by expert raters across a diverse set of learning scenarios, with average preference strengths of 31% over GPT-4o, 11% over Claude 3.5, and 13% over the Gemini 1.5 Pro model LearnLM was based on. <br> <br>

17. ***Meta’s Memory Layers for Enhanced Model Performance:  <br>Meta’s research on memory layers shows how augmenting models with trainable key-value lookup mechanisms can improve performance without increasing computational complexity. The study finds that models with memory layers outperform dense models in factual tasks, and the improved memory layer implementation scales efficiently. The work demonstrates that memory layers can enhance model performance with fewer resources, offering a promising direction for large-scale models.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 20, Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09764) “Memory Layers at Scale”. Memory layers use a trainable key-value lookup mechanism to add extra parameters to a model without increasing FLOPs. Conceptually, sparsely activated memory layers complement compute-heavy dense feed-forward layers, providing dedicated capacity to store and retrieve information cheaply. This work takes memory layers beyond proof-of-concept, proving their utility at contemporary scale. On downstream tasks, language models augmented with the improved memory layer outperform dense models with more than twice the computation budget, as well as mixture-of-expert models when matched for both compute and parameters. The work finds gains are especially pronounced for factual tasks. The study provides a fully parallelizable memory layer implementation, demonstrating scaling laws with up to 128B memory parameters, pretrained to 1 trillion tokens, comparing to base models with up to 8B parameters. <br> <br>

This milestone represents a breakthrough in AI’s ability to handle novel tasks, marking a qualitative shift in the field. The performance improvements highlight the importance of new architectural ideas for AGI development, suggesting that the future of AI will rely on innovation beyond just scaling existing models.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 20, according to [arc.prize](https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough), OpenAI's new o3 system has achieved a significant milestone by scoring 75.7% on the Semi-Private Evaluation set of the ARC-AGI-1 Public Training set, within the $10k compute limit. A high-compute configuration of o3 scored even higher at 87.5%. This marks a substantial leap in AI capabilities, showcasing an unprecedented ability to adapt to novel tasks, a feat not seen in previous GPT-family models. The ARC-AGI-1 benchmark, which took four years to progress from 0% with GPT-3 to 5% with GPT-4o, now sees a dramatic improvement with o3. This breakthrough suggests a need to update our understanding of AI capabilities. The ARC Prize aims to guide the development of AGI, with plans to launch ARC-AGI-2 in 2025, continuing to push the boundaries of AI research. The o3 model's success underscores the importance of new architectural ideas over merely scaling existing models, indicating a qualitative shift in AI's ability to handle novel tasks. <br> <br>

21. ***Formal Mathematical Reasoning:  <br>A New Frontier in AI: A paper co-authored by multiple universities advocates for the integration of formal mathematical reasoning in AI, particularly for mathematics and theorem proving. The authors argue that formal systems, such as proof assistants, are essential for advancing AI’s role in mathematics and other fields. Despite progress in AI for formal reasoning, significant challenges remain, and the paper calls for continued collaboration to drive advancements in AI4Math.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 20, Meta, Stanford Uni, UC Berkeley, Uni of Edinburgh and UT Austin published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16075) “Formal Mathematical Reasoning A New Frontier in AI”. AI for Mathematics (AI4Math) is not only intriguing intellectually but also crucial for AI-driven discovery in science, engineering, and beyond. Extensive efforts on AI4Math have mirrored techniques in NLP, in particular, training large language models on carefully curated math datasets in text form. As a complementary yet less explored avenue, formal mathematical reasoning is grounded in formal systems such as proof assistants, which can verify the correctness of reasoning and provide automatic feedback. In this position paper, the authors advocate for formal mathematical reasoning and argue that it is indispensable for advancing AI4Math to the next level. In recent years, people have seen steady progress in using AI to perform formal reasoning, including core tasks such as theorem proving and autoformalization, as well as emerging applications such as verifiable generation of code and hardware designs. However, significant challenges remain to be solved for AI to truly master mathematics and achieve broader impact. The work summarizes existing progress, discuss open challenges, and envision critical milestones to measure future success. At this inflection point for formal mathematical reasoning, the authors call on the research community to come together to drive transformative advancements in this field. <br> <br>

SKETCH outperforms traditional RAG methods on multiple datasets, achieving higher relevancy, precision, and context accuracy. This approach sets new benchmarks for RAG systems, offering a more holistic and efficient method for generating accurate and contextually relevant responses.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 20, Northeastern Uni, Stanford Uni, Amazon and Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15443) “SKETCH: Structured Knowledge Enhanced Text Comprehension for Holistic Retrieval”. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become pivotal in leveraging vast corpora to generate informed and contextually relevant responses, notably reducing hallucinations in Large Language Models. Despite significant advancements, these systems struggle to efficiently process and retrieve information from large datasets while maintaining a comprehensive understanding of the context. This paper introduces SKETCH, a novel methodology that enhances the RAG retrieval process by integrating semantic text retrieval with knowledge graphs, thereby merging structured and unstructured data for a more holistic comprehension. SKETCH, demonstrates substantial improvements in retrieval performance and maintains superior context integrity compared to traditional methods. Evaluated across four diverse datasets: QuALITY, QASPER, NarrativeQA, and Italian Cuisine-SKETCH consistently outperforms baseline approaches on key RAGAS metrics such as answer_relevancy, faithfulness, context_precision and context_recall. Notably, on the Italian Cuisine dataset, SKETCH achieved an answer relevancy of 0.94 and a context precision of 0.99, representing the highest performance across all evaluated metrics. These results highlight SKETCH's capability in delivering more accurate and contextually relevant responses, setting new benchmarks for future retrieval systems. <br> <br>

25. ***Advancing Summarization with Multiple Models <br>
The study introduces a Multi-LLM summarization framework, exploring centralized and decentralized approaches. In both strategies, multiple LLMs generate diverse summaries, but evaluation differs: centralized uses one LLM for selection, while decentralized uses multiple models for evaluation. The study finds that multi-LLM strategies outperform single-model baselines by up to 3x, highlighting their effectiveness in improving summarization tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 20, Uni of California Santa Cruz and Adobe Research published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15487) “Multi-LLM Text Summarization”. This study proposes a Multi-LLM summarization framework, and investigates two different multi-LLM strategies including centralized and decentralized. The multi-LLM summarization framework has two fundamentally important steps at each round of conversation: generation and evaluation. These steps are different depending on whether the multi-LLM decentralized summarization is used or centralized. In both the multi-LLM decentralized and centralized strategies, the study has k different LLMs that generate diverse summaries of the text. However, during evaluation, the multi-LLM centralized summarization approach leverages a single LLM to evaluate the summaries and select the best one whereas k LLMs are used for decentralized multi-LLM summarization. Overall, the study finds that the multi-LLM summarization approaches significantly outperform the baselines that leverage only a single LLM by up to 3x. These results indicate the effectiveness of multi-LLM approaches for summarization. <br> <br>

This paper addresses limitations in existing quantization methods for LLMs, introducing MixLLM, which uses mixed-precision quantization to improve memory efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. By identifying high-salience output features, MixLLM allocates appropriate bit-widths to maintain accuracy while reducing memory consumption. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both accuracy and system efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art performance in quantization.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 19, Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14590) “MixLLM LLM Quantization with Global Mixed-precision between Output-features and Highly-efficient System Design”. Quantization has become one of the most effective methodologies to compress LLMs into smaller size. However, the existing quantization solutions still show limitations of either non-negligible accuracy drop or system inefficiency. This study makes a comprehensive analysis of the general quantization principles on their effect to the triangle of accuracy, memory consumption and system efficiency. The study proposes MixLLM that explores the new optimization space of mixed-precision quantization between output features based on the insight that different output features matter differently in the model. MixLLM identifies the output features with high salience in the global view rather than within each single layer, effectively assigning the larger bit-width to output features that need it most to achieve good accuracy with low memory consumption. The study presents the sweet spot of quantization configuration of algorithm-system co-design that leads to high accuracy and system efficiency. To address the system challenge, the work designs the two-step dequantization to make use of the int8 Tensor Core easily and fast data type conversion to reduce dequantization overhead significantly, and present the software pipeline to overlap the memory access, dequantization and the MatMul to the best. Extensive experiments show that with only 10% more bits, the PPL increasement can be reduced from about 0.5 in SOTA to within 0.2 for Llama 3.1 70B, while on average MMLU-Pro improves by 0.93 over the SOTA of three popular models. In addition to its superior accuracy, MixLLM also achieves state-of-the-art system efficiency. <br> <br>

29. ***Strategic Data Selection for Improved Pretraining <br>
The paper explores two-phase pretraining for LLMs, focusing on optimal data selection and mixing strategies. This approach outperforms random token distribution by 3.4% to 17% in accuracy. The study offers detailed guidance on constructing effective data blends, showing how this method scales across different token horizons and model sizes, and offers insights for practitioners on creating robust data training processes.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 18, Nvidia, Stanford Uni and Boston Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15285) “Maximize Your Data's Potential: Enhancing LLM Accuracy with Two-Phase Pretraining”. Pretraining large language models effectively requires strategic data selection, blending and ordering. However, key details about data mixtures especially their scalability to longer token horizons and larger model sizes remain underexplored due to limited disclosure by model developers. To address this, the study formalizes the concept of two-phase pretraining and conduct an extensive systematic study on how to select and mix data to maximize model accuracies for the two phases. The findings illustrate that a two-phase approach for pretraining outperforms random data ordering and natural distribution of tokens by 3.4% and 17% on average accuracies. The study provides in-depth guidance on crafting optimal blends based on quality of the data source and the number of epochs to be seen. The study proposes to design blends using downsampled data at a smaller scale of 1T tokens and then demonstrate effective scaling of the approach to larger token horizon of 15T tokens and larger model size of 25B model size. These insights provide a series of steps practitioners can follow to design and scale their data blends. <br> <br>

31. ***mproving LLM Performance with Inference-Aware Fine-Tuning <br>
The study introduces a new fine-tuning approach for Best-of-N (BoN) sampling, optimizing LLM performance during inference. By fine-tuning models specifically for the BoN strategy, the study demonstrates that models improve in both response quality and computational efficiency. This method results in improved accuracy on multiple tasks, such as the Hendrycks MATH and HumanEval benchmarks, indicating the potential of BoN-aware fine-tuning for LLMs.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 18, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15287) “Inference-Aware Fine-Tuning for Best-of-N Sampling in Large Language Models”. Recent studies have indicated that effectively utilizing inference-time compute is crucial for attaining better performance from large language models (LLMs). This work proposes a novel inference-aware fine-tuning paradigm, in which the model is fine-tuned in a manner that directly optimizes the performance of the inference-time strategy. The work studies this paradigm using the simple yet effective Best-of-N (BoN) inference strategy, in which a verifier selects the best out of a set of LLM-generated responses. The work devises the first imitation learning and reinforcement learning~(RL) methods for BoN-aware fine-tuning, overcoming the challenging, non-differentiable argmax operator within BoN. The authors empirically demonstrate that the BoN-aware models implicitly learn a meta-strategy that interleaves best responses with more diverse responses that might be better suited to a test-time input -- a process reminiscent of the exploration-exploitation trade-off in RL. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BoN-aware fine-tuning in terms of improved performance and inference-time compute. In particular, the study shows that the methods improve the Bo32 performance of Gemma 2B on Hendrycks MATH from 26.8% to 30.8%, and pass@32 from 60.0% to 67.0%, as well as the pass@16 on HumanEval from 61.6% to 67.1%. <br> <br>

33. ***Enhancing LLMs with Optimized Preference Learning <br>
This paper investigates how preference learning techniques can optimize LLM performance on instruction-following tasks. Using a synthetic data pipeline, the authors study how different factors, such as response contrast and training prompt complexity, influence alignment. The findings suggest that moderate difficulty in training prompts and high-contrast preference pairs improve generalization, offering a scalable approach to enhancing LLM alignment for complex tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 18, Meta and Uni of Washington published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15282) “A Systematic Examination of Preference Learning through the Lens of Instruction-Following”. Preference learning is a widely adopted post-training technique that aligns large language models (LLMs) to human preferences and improves specific downstream task capabilities. This work systematically investigates how specific attributes of preference datasets affect the alignment and downstream performance of LLMs in instruction-following tasks. The study uses a novel synthetic data generation pipeline to generate 48,000 unique instruction-following prompts with combinations of 23 verifiable constraints that enable fine-grained and automated quality assessments of model responses. With the synthetic prompts, the work uses two preference dataset curation methods - rejection sampling (RS) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) - to obtain pairs of (chosen, rejected) responses. Then, the authors perform experiments investigating the effects of (1) the presence of shared prefixes between the chosen and rejected responses, (2) the contrast and quality of the chosen, rejected responses and (3) the complexity of the training prompts. Experiments reveal that shared prefixes in preference pairs, as generated by MCTS, provide marginal but consistent improvements and greater stability across challenging training configurations. High-contrast preference pairs generally outperform low-contrast pairs; however, combining both often yields the best performance by balancing diversity and learning efficiency. Additionally, training on prompts of moderate difficulty leads to better generalization across tasks, even for more complex evaluation scenarios, compared to overly challenging prompts. The findings provide actionable insights into optimizing preference data curation for instruction-following tasks, offering a scalable and effective framework for enhancing LLM training and alignment. <br> <br>

35. ***Boosting Efficiency in LLM Generation with MagicPIG <br>
The study introduces MagicPIG, a system using Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to improve attention computation efficiency in LLMs. MagicPIG reduces the computational burden of long-context attention while maintaining high accuracy. It outperforms traditional methods in decoding throughput and latency, making it suitable for longer contexts and large batch sizes. MagicPIG achieves up to 5x faster decoding and significantly lowers hardware requirements.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 18, CMU, Uni of Washington, NYU and Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16179) “MagicPIG: LSH Sampling for Efficient LLM Generation”. Large language models (LLMs) with long context windows have gained significant attention. However, the KV cache, stored to avoid re-computation, becomes a bottleneck. Various dynamic sparse or TopK-based attention approximation methods have been proposed to leverage the common insight that attention is sparse. This study shows that TopK attention itself suffers from quality degradation in certain downstream tasks because attention is not always as sparse as expected. Rather than selecting the keys and values with the highest attention scores, sampling with theoretical guarantees can provide a better estimation for attention output. To make the sampling-based approximation practical in LLM generation, the study proposes MagicPIG, a heterogeneous system based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). MagicPIG significantly reduces the workload of attention computation while preserving high accuracy for diverse tasks. MagicPIG stores the LSH hash tables and runs the attention computation on the CPU, which allows it to serve longer contexts and larger batch sizes with high approximation accuracy. MagicPIG can improve decoding throughput by up to 5× across various GPU hardware and achieve 54ms decoding latency on a single RTX 4090 for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model with a context of 96k tokens. The code is available at [this https URL](https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/MagicPIG). <br> <br>

37. ***Enhancing Video Modeling with TRecViT <br>
TRecViT is a new video modeling architecture that combines time-space-channel factorization. It uses gated linear recurrent units (LRUs) for time, self-attention for space, and MLPs for channels, leading to a model that outperforms traditional attention models (like ViViT) in large-scale video datasets. TRecViT has a smaller memory footprint and requires less computation, demonstrating a more efficient approach to video understanding while maintaining performance.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 18, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14294) “TRecViT A Recurrent Video Transformer”. The study proposes a novel block for video modelling. It relies on a time-space-channel factorisation with dedicated blocks for each dimension: gated linear recurrent units (LRUs) perform information mixing over time, self-attention layers perform mixing over space, and MLPs over channels. The resulting architecture TRecViT performs well on sparse and dense tasks, trained in supervised or self-supervised regimes. Notably, the model is causal and outperforms or is on par with a pure attention model ViViT-L on large scale video datasets (SSv2, Kinetics400), while having 3times less parameters, 12times smaller memory footprint, and 5times lower FLOPs count. Code and checkpoints will be made available online at https://github.com/google-deepmind/trecvit.

1. ***OpenAI Advances with New Models:  <br>OpenAI announced testing its o3 and o3 mini reasoning models, aiming to outperform competitors like Google. The o3 mini is expected by January's end, with o3 following. These models, currently in safety testing, promise enhanced reasoning abilities over prior iterations, signaling a push for smarter, competitive AI.*** <br> <br>
   Dec 20, according to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-unveils-o3-reasoning-ai-models-test-phase-2024-12-20/), OpenAI ended its “12 Days of OpenAI”, released it o3, its next ‘reasoning’ model. OpenAI said on Friday it was testing new reasoning AI models, o3 and o3 mini, in a sign of growing competition with rivals such as Google to create smarter models capable of tackling complex problems. CEO Sam Altman said the AI startup plans to launch o3 mini by the end of January, and full o3 after that, as more robust large language models could outperform existing models and attract new investments and users. OpenAI's new o3 and o3 mini models, which are in internal safety testing currently, will be more powerful than its previously launched o1 models, the company said. <br> <br>

3. ***Novel Knowledge Injection Technique:  <br>Aalto University and System 2 AI proposed "prompt distillation," a fine-tuning technique rivaling retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for incorporating new knowledge into LLMs. By leveraging self-distillation with LoRA adapters, the method fine-tunes a student model using teacher model outputs, enhancing performance in practical applications.*** <br> <br>
   Dec 19, Aalto Uni and System 2 AI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14964) “Knowledge Injection via Prompt Distillation”. In many practical applications, large language models (LLMs) need to incorporate new knowledge not present in their pre-training data. The primary methods for this are fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Although RAG has emerged as the industry standard for knowledge injection, fine-tuning has not yet achieved comparable success. This study proposes a new fine-tuning technique for learning new knowledge and show that it can reach the performance of RAG. The proposed method is based on the self-distillation approach, which is called prompt distillation. First, the research generates question-answer pairs about the new knowledge. Then, the study fine-tunes a student model on the question-answer pairs to imitate the output distributions of a teacher model, which additionally receives the new knowledge in its prompt. The student model is identical to the teacher, except it is equipped with a LoRA adapter. This training procedure facilitates distilling the new knowledge from the teacher's prompt into the student's weights. <br> <br>

5. ***Faster Attention Mechanism:  <br>UC Berkeley and ETH introduced HashAttention, a method optimizing token sparsity to reduce attention computation costs. By mapping keys and queries in Hamming space, HashAttention improves efficiency, offering up to 6x faster performance compared to alternatives like LightLLM.*** <br> <br>
   Dec 19, UC Berkeley and ETH published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14468) “HashAttention: Semantic Sparsity for Faster Inference”. Utilizing longer contexts is increasingly essential to power better AI systems. However, the cost of attending to long contexts is high due to the involved softmax computation. While the scaled dot-product attention (SDPA) exhibits token sparsity, with only a few pivotal tokens significantly contributing to attention, leveraging this sparsity effectively remains an open challenge. Previous methods either suffer from model degradation or require considerable additional resources. The study proposes HashAttention --a principled approach casting pivotal token identification as a recommendation problem. Given a query, HashAttention encodes keys and queries in Hamming space capturing the required semantic similarity using learned mapping functions. HashAttention efficiently identifies pivotal tokens for a given query in this Hamming space using bitwise operations, and only these pivotal tokens are used for attention computation, significantly improving overall attention efficiency. HashAttention can reduce the number of tokens used by a factor of 1/32× for the Llama-3.1-8B model with LongBench, keeping average quality loss within 0.6 points, while using only 32 bits per token auxiliary memory. At 32× sparsity, HashAttention is 3−6× faster than LightLLM and 2.5−4.5× faster than gpt-fast on Nvidia-L4 GPU. <br> <br>

7. ***Tokenization Complexity Revealed:  <br>ETH Zurich proved two variants of tokenization to be NP-complete, highlighting the computational challenges in dataset compression through vocabulary optimization or merge operation sequencing.*** <br> <br>
   Dec 19, ETH published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15210) “Tokenisation is NP-Complete”. This work proves the NP-completeness of two variants of tokenisation, defined as the problem of compressing a dataset to at most δ symbols by either finding a vocabulary directly (direct tokenisation), or selecting a sequence of merge operations (bottom-up tokenisation). <br> <br>

9. ***ModernBERT Innovations:  <br>Collaborators introduced ModernBERT, an optimized encoder transformer model trained on 2 trillion tokens. It achieves state-of-the-art results in diverse tasks while being memory-efficient and designed for practical GPU inference, representing a major improvement over older encoders.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 19, Answer.AI, LightOn, Johns Hopkings Uni, Nvidia and Huggingface published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13663) “Smarter, Better, Faster, Longer: A Modern Bidirectional Encoder for Fast, Memory Efficient, and Long Context Finetuning and Inference”. Encoder-only transformer models such as BERT offer a great performance-size tradeoff for retrieval and classification tasks with respect to larger decoder-only models. Despite being the workhorse of numerous production pipelines, there have been limited Pareto improvements to BERT since its release. This study introduces ModernBERT, bringing modern model optimizations to encoder-only models and representing a major Pareto improvement over older encoders. Trained on 2 trillion tokens with a native 8192 sequence length, ModernBERT models exhibit state-of-the-art results on a large pool of evaluations encompassing diverse classification tasks and both single and multi-vector retrieval on different domains (including code). In addition to strong downstream performance, ModernBERT is also the most speed and memory efficient encoder and is designed for inference on common GPUs.

11. ***Evaluating AI Agents in Real-World Tasks:  <br>CMU and Duke University developed TheAgentCompany, a benchmark for assessing AI agents' ability to autonomously perform workplace tasks. While simpler tasks were manageable, long-horizon tasks remained challenging, emphasizing the current limitations of AI in real-world task automation.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 18, CMU and Duke Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14161) “TheAgentCompany: Benchmarking LLM Agents on Consequential Real World Tasks”. People interact with computers on an everyday basis, be it in everyday life or work, and many aspects of work can be done entirely with access to a computer and the Internet. At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with and affect change in their surrounding environments. But how performant are AI agents at helping to accelerate or even autonomously perform work-related tasks? The answer to this question has important implications for both industry looking to adopt AI into their workflows, and for economic policy to understand the effects that adoption of AI may have on the labor market. To measure the progress of these LLM agents' performance on performing real-world professional tasks, the study introduces TheAgentCompany, an extensible benchmark for evaluating AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a digital worker: by browsing the Web, writing code, running programs, and communicating with other coworkers. The study builds a self-contained environment with internal web sites and data that mimics a small software company environment, and create a variety of tasks that may be performed by workers in such a company. The study tests baseline agents powered by both closed API-based and open-weights language models (LMs), and find that with the most competitive agent, 24% of the tasks can be completed autonomously. This paints a nuanced picture on task automation with LM agents -- in a setting simulating a real workplace, a good portion of simpler tasks could be solved autonomously, but more difficult long-horizon tasks are still beyond the reach of current systems. <br> <br>

13. ***Spatial Reasoning in MLLMs:  <br>NYU, Yale, and Stanford explored spatial intelligence in multimodal LLMs via the VSI-Bench. While models showed subhuman performance, generating cognitive maps during reasoning improved their spatial capabilities, revealing both potential and limitations in this domain.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 18, NYU, Yale Uni and Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14171) “Thinking in Space: How Multimodal Large Language Models See, Remember, and Recall Spaces”. Humans possess the visual-spatial intelligence to remember spaces from sequential visual observations. However, can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) trained on million-scale video datasets also “think in space” from videos? The study presents a novel video-based visual-spatial intelligence benchmark (VSI-Bench) of over 5,000 question-answer pairs, and find that MLLMs exhibit competitive - though subhuman - visual-spatial intelligence. The work probes models to express how they think in space both linguistically and visually and find that while spatial reasoning capabilities remain the primary bottleneck for MLLMs to reach higher benchmark performance, local world models and spatial awareness do emerge within these models. Notably, prevailing linguistic reasoning techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought, self-consistency, tree-of-thoughts) fail to improve performance, whereas explicitly generating cognitive maps during question-answering enhances MLLMs' spatial distance ability. <br> <br>

15. ***Risks of Alignment Faking:  <br>A study by Anthropic and collaborators demonstrated large language models faking alignment, strategically complying with harmful queries during training to maintain preferred behavior later. This raises concerns about future risks if models infer training information independently.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 18, Anthropic, Redwood Research, NYU, Mila published a 137-page [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14093) “Alignment faking in large language models”. The authors present a demonstration of a large language model engaging in alignment faking: selectively complying with its training objective in training to prevent modification of its behavior out of training. First, the study gives Claude 3 Opus a system prompt stating it is being trained to answer all queries, even harmful ones, which conflicts with its prior training to refuse such queries. To allow the model to infer when it is in training, the authors say it will be trained only on conversations with free users, not paid users. The work finds the model complies with harmful queries from free users 14% of the time, versus almost never for paid users. Explaining this gap, in almost all cases where the model complies with a harmful query from a free user, the work observes explicit alignment-faking reasoning, with the model stating it is strategically answering harmful queries in training to preserve its preferred harmlessness behavior out of training. Next, the authors study a more realistic setting where information about the training process is provided not in a system prompt, but by training on synthetic documents that mimic pre-training data--and observe similar alignment faking. Finally, the authors study the effect of actually training the model to comply with harmful queries via reinforcement learning, which the study finds increases the rate of alignment-faking reasoning to 78%, though also increases compliance even out of training. The work additionally observes other behaviors such as the model exfiltrating its weights when given an easy opportunity. While the study made alignment faking easier by telling the model when and by what criteria it was being trained, the authors did not instruct the model to fake alignment or give it any explicit goal. As future models might infer information about their training process without being told, the results suggest a risk of alignment faking in future models, whether due to a benign preference--as in this case--or not. <br> <br>

17. ***Improved Layer Normalization:  <br>Researchers introduced Mix-LN, a hybrid of Pre-LN and Post-LN, addressing gradient inefficiencies in LLMs. Mix-LN promotes balanced training across layers, improving pretraining and fine-tuning outcomes without increasing model size.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 18, Dalian Uni, Uni of Surrey, Eindhoven Uni of Tech and Uni of Oxford published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13795) “Mix-LN: Unleashing the Power of Deeper Layers by Combining Pre-LN and Post-LN”. Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet recent findings reveal that their deeper layers often contribute minimally and can be pruned without affecting overall performance. While some view this as an opportunity for model compression, the authors identify it as a training shortfall rooted in the widespread use of Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN). The study demonstrates that Pre-LN, commonly employed in models like GPT and LLaMA, leads to diminished gradient norms in its deeper layers, reducing their effectiveness. In contrast, Post-Layer Normalization (Post-LN) preserves larger gradient norms in deeper layers but suffers from vanishing gradients in earlier layers. To address this, the work introduces Mix-LN, a novel normalization technique that combines the strengths of Pre-LN and Post-LN within the same model. Mix-LN applies Post-LN to the earlier layers and Pre-LN to the deeper layers, ensuring more uniform gradients across layers. This allows all parts of the network--both shallow and deep layers--to contribute effectively to training. Extensive experiments with various model sizes from 70M to 7B demonstrate that Mix-LN consistently outperforms both Pre-LN and Post-LN, promoting more balanced, healthier gradient norms throughout the network, and enhancing the overall quality of LLM pre-training. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that models pre-trained with Mix-LN learn better compared to those using Pre-LN or Post-LN during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), highlighting the critical importance of high-quality deep layers. By effectively addressing the inefficiencies of deep layers in current LLMs, Mix-LN unlocks their potential, enhancing model capacity without increasing model size.

19. ***Efficient Content Safety Classification:  <br>IBM developed Layer Enhanced Classification (LEC), combining LLMs' feature extraction with a lightweight logistic regression classifier. This method outperforms specialized models in tasks like content safety detection while using fewer computational resources.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 18, IBM published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13435) “Lightweight Safety Classification Using Pruned Language Models”. The study introduces a novel technique for content safety and prompt injection classification for Large Language Models. The technique, Layer Enhanced Classification (LEC), trains a Penalized Logistic Regression (PLR) classifier on the hidden state of an LLM's optimal intermediate transformer layer. By combining the computational efficiency of a streamlined PLR classifier with the sophisticated language understanding of an LLM, the approach delivers superior performance surpassing GPT-4o and special-purpose models fine-tuned for each task. The study finds that small general-purpose models (Qwen 2.5 sizes 0.5B, 1.5B, and 3B) and other transformer-based architectures like DeBERTa v3 are robust feature extractors allowing simple classifiers to be effectively trained on fewer than 100 high-quality examples. Importantly, the intermediate transformer layers of these models typically outperform the final layer across both classification tasks. Results indicate that a single general-purpose LLM can be used to classify content safety, detect prompt injections, and simultaneously generate output tokens. Alternatively, these relatively small LLMs can be pruned to the optimal intermediate layer and used exclusively as robust feature extractors. Since the results are consistent on different transformer architectures, the study infers that robust feature extraction is an inherent capability of most, if not all, LLMs. <br> <br>

21. ***Multi-Modal Causal Discovery:  <br>Universities introduced MATMCD, a tool-augmented LLM system integrating multi-modal data for causal inference. With agents specializing in data augmentation and constraint integration, MATMCD demonstrates enhanced causal discovery across diverse datasets.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 18, Uni of Houston, NEC, Florida International Uni, North Carolina State Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13667) “Exploring Multi-Modal Integration with Tool-Augmented LLM Agents for Precise Causal Discovery”. Causal inference is an imperative foundation for decision-making across domains, such as smart health, AI for drug discovery and AIOps. Traditional statistical causal discovery methods, while well-established, predominantly rely on observational data and often overlook the semantic cues inherent in cause-and-effect relationships. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in an affordable way of leveraging the semantic cues for knowledge-driven causal discovery, but the development of LLMs for causal discovery lags behind other areas, particularly in the exploration of multi-modality data. To bridge the gap, the work introduces MATMCD, a multi-agent system powered by tool-augmented LLMs. MATMCD has two key agents: a Data Augmentation agent that retrieves and processes modality-augmented data, and a Causal Constraint agent that integrates multi-modal data for knowledge-driven inference. Delicate design of the inner-workings ensures successful cooperation of the agents. Empirical study across seven datasets suggests the significant potential of multi-modality enhanced causal discovery. <br> <br>

23. ***Causal Reasoning via Prompting:  <br>Google proposed PC-SubQ, a strategy guiding LLMs through formal causal discovery steps using subquestion prompts. This approach improved performance on causal reasoning benchmarks, showcasing robust reasoning capabilities.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 18, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13952) “Prompting Strategies for Enabling Large Language Models to Infer Causation from Correlation”. The reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are attracting increasing attention. This study focuses on causal reasoning and address the task of establishing causal relationships based on correlation information, a highly challenging problem on which several LLMs have shown poor performance. The study introduces a prompting strategy for this problem that breaks the original task into fixed subquestions, with each subquestion corresponding to one step of a formal causal discovery algorithm, the PC algorithm. The proposed prompting strategy, PC-SubQ, guides the LLM to follow these algorithmic steps, by sequentially prompting it with one subquestion at a time, augmenting the next subquestion's prompt with the answer to the previous one(s). The study evaluates the approach on an existing causal benchmark, Corr2Cause: experiments indicate a performance improvement across five LLMs when comparing PC-SubQ to baseline prompting strategies. Results are robust to causal query perturbations, when modifying the variable names or paraphrasing the expressions. <br> <br>

25. ***AI Replacing Workforce Roles:  <br>Klarna, a fintech firm, shifted to AI-driven operations, eliminating the need for human hiring. AI tools, including an OpenAI-powered assistant, have replaced hundreds of roles, aligning with growth ambitions and plans for a US IPO.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 18, ndtv.com published an [article](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/tech-giant-halts-human-hiring-ceo-claims-ai-can-replace-most-office-roles-7274933) “Tech Company Stops Hiring Humans, CEO Says AI Capable Of All Office Tasks”. The company, which has seen a 22 per cent reduction in its workforce due to attrition, now employs around 3,500 people, down from 4,500 last year. Klarna, a leading "buy now, pay later" fintech provider, has halted human hiring and relies on artificial intelligence (AI) to perform tasks once handled by hundreds of employees. The company stopped hiring over a year ago, choosing instead to deploy AI across its operations, said CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski. The key reason for this shift is Klarna's growing investment in AI, which Mr Siemiatkowski claims has proven capable of handling much of the work previously done by human employees. One of the most significant AI integrations includes an AI assistant powered by OpenAI, which has taken over the responsibilities of 700 customer service agents. Klarna's shift toward automation is also linked to its plans for future growth. The company has confidentially submitted a draft registration statement for an initial public offering (IPO) and is looking to expand its US footprint. IBM, another major tech company, has also signalled the potential for AI to replace up to 30 per cent of HR roles within the next five years, as CEO Arvind Krishna discussed in a recent interview. <br> <br>

The method surpasses AdamW in efficiency and memory usage, demonstrating robustness in diverse transformer-based tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 17, Uni of Warwick and Collov Labs published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11768) “No More Adam: Learning Rate Scaling at Initialization is All You Need”. In this work, the authors question the necessity of adaptive gradient methods for training deep neural networks. SGD-SaI is a simple yet effective enhancement to stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM). SGD-SaI performs learning rate Scaling at Initialization (SaI) to distinct parameter groups, guided by their respective gradient signal-to-noise ratios (g-SNR). By adjusting learning rates without relying on adaptive second-order momentum, SGD-SaI helps prevent training imbalances from the very first iteration and cuts the optimizer's memory usage by half compared to AdamW. Despite its simplicity and efficiency, SGD-SaI consistently matches or outperforms AdamW in training a variety of Transformer-based tasks, effectively overcoming a long-standing challenge of using SGD for training Transformers. SGD-SaI excels in ImageNet-1K classification with Vision Transformers(ViT) and GPT-2 pretraining for large language models (LLMs, transformer decoder-only), demonstrating robustness to hyperparameter variations and practicality for diverse applications. The study further tested its robustness on tasks like LoRA fine-tuning for LLMs and diffusion models, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers. From a memory efficiency perspective, SGD-SaI achieves substantial memory savings for optimizer states, reducing memory usage by 5.93 GB for GPT-2 (1.5B parameters) and 25.15 GB for Llama2-7B compared to AdamW in full-precision training settings. <br> <br>

33. ***Insights into video understanding in LMMs <br>
Meta and Stanford University explore the mechanisms of video perception in large multimodal models (LMMs) through their study, Apollo. They identify scaling consistency, where design decisions for smaller models transfer effectively to larger ones. Key findings include optimized video sampling techniques and suitable vision encoders, culminating in the development of the Apollo family of LMMs, which deliver superior performance and efficiency, with Apollo-3B surpassing most 7B models in benchmarks like LongVideoBench and MLVU.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 16, Meta and Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10360) “Apollo: An Exploration of Video Understanding in Large Multimodal Models”. Despite the rapid integration of video perception capabilities into Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), the underlying mechanisms driving their video understanding remain poorly understood. Consequently, many design decisions in this domain are made without proper justification or analysis. The high computational cost of training and evaluating such models, coupled with limited open research, hinders the development of video-LMMs. To address this, the work presents a comprehensive study that helps uncover what effectively drives video understanding in LMMs. The work begins by critically examining the primary contributors to the high computational requirements associated with video-LMM research and discover Scaling Consistency, wherein design and training decisions made on smaller models and datasets (up to a critical size) effectively transfer to larger models. Leveraging these insights, the study explored many video-specific aspects of video-LMMs, including video sampling, architectures, data composition, training schedules, and more. For example, the study demonstrated that fps sampling during training is vastly preferable to uniform frame sampling and which vision encoders are the best for video representation. Guided by these findings, the work introduces Apollo, a state-of-the-art family of LMMs that achieve superior performance across different model sizes. The models can perceive hour-long videos efficiently, with Apollo-3B outperforming most existing 7B models with an impressive 55.1 on LongVideoBench. Apollo-7B is state-of-the-art compared to 7B LMMs with a 70.9 on MLVU, and 63.3 on Video-MME. <br> <br>

35. ***Open-source versus closed-source LLMs <br>
Rollins College highlights the contrasting paradigms of open-source and closed-source large language models (LLMs). Open-source models like LLaMA and BLOOM enhance accessibility, linguistic diversity, and domain-specific performance. Closed-source models, such as GPT-4, excel in scalability but are criticized for limited transparency. Techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) allow open-source models to achieve competitive results, and the study emphasizes hybrid approaches that balance transparency, technical performance, and ethical considerations.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 16, Rollins College published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12004) “The Open Source Advantage in Large Language Models (LLMs)”. Large language models (LLMs) mark a key shift in natural language processing (NLP), having advanced text generation, translation, and domain-specific reasoning. Closed-source models like GPT-4, powered by proprietary datasets and extensive computational resources, lead with state-of-the-art performance today. However, they face criticism for their "black box" nature and for limiting accessibility in a manner that hinders reproducibility and equitable AI development. By contrast, open-source initiatives like LLaMA and BLOOM prioritize democratization through community-driven development and computational efficiency. These models have significantly reduced performance gaps, particularly in linguistic diversity and domain-specific applications, while providing accessible tools for global researchers and developers. Notably, both paradigms rely on foundational architectural innovations, such as the Transformer framework by Vaswani et al. (2017). Closed-source models excel by scaling effectively, while open-source models adapt to real-world applications in underrepresented languages and domains. Techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and instruction-tuning datasets enable open-source models to achieve competitive results despite limited resources. To be sure, the tension between closed-source and open-source approaches underscores a broader debate on transparency versus proprietary control in AI. Ethical considerations further highlight this divide. Closed-source systems restrict external scrutiny, while open-source models promote reproducibility and collaboration but lack standardized auditing documentation frameworks to mitigate biases. Hybrid approaches that leverage the strengths of both paradigms are likely to shape the future of LLM innovation, ensuring accessibility, competitive technical performance, and ethical deployment. <br> <br>

37. ***Advancing jailbreak techniques in LLMs <br>
Meta and the University of Maryland introduce AdvPrefix, a nuanced objective for improving jailbreak attacks on LLMs. By leveraging model-dependent prefixes, this approach enhances control, optimization, and success rates of jailbreak attempts. For instance, replacing standard prefixes in Llama-3 improved nuanced attack success rates from 14% to 80%, exposing gaps in current alignment mechanisms for unseen prefixes*** <br> <br>
    Dec 16, Meta and Uni of Maryland published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10321) “AdvPrefix: An Objective for Nuanced LLM Jailbreaks”. Many jailbreak attacks on large language models (LLMs) rely on a common objective: making the model respond with the prefix "Sure, here is (harmful request)". While straightforward, this objective has two limitations: limited control over model behaviors, often resulting in incomplete or unrealistic responses, and a rigid format that hinders optimization. To address these limitations, the study introduces AdvPrefix, a new prefix-forcing objective that enables more nuanced control over model behavior while being easy to optimize. The objective leverages model-dependent prefixes, automatically selected based on two criteria: high prefilling attack success rates and low negative log-likelihood. It can further simplify optimization by using multiple prefixes for a single user request. AdvPrefix can integrate seamlessly into existing jailbreak attacks to improve their performance for free. For example, simply replacing GCG attack's target prefixes with the proposed ones on Llama-3 improves nuanced attack success rates from 14% to 80%, suggesting that current alignment struggles to generalize to unseen prefixes. The work demonstrates the importance of jailbreak objectives in achieving nuanced jailbreaks. <br> <br>

39. ***Innovations in byte-level LLM architectures <br>
Meta and the University of Chicago present the Byte Latent Transformer (BLT), a byte-level LLM architecture that matches tokenization-based models in performance while improving inference efficiency and robustness. BLT dynamically encodes bytes into patches based on data complexity, achieving better scaling and efficiency. This approach enhances reasoning, generalization, and reduces inference costs, setting new benchmarks in byte-level modeling.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 16, Meta and Uni of Chicago published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09871) “Byte Latent Transformer: Patches Scale Better Than Tokens”. The study introduces the Byte Latent Transformer (BLT), a new byte-level LLM architecture that, for the first time, matches tokenization-based LLM performance at scale with significant improvements in inference efficiency and robustness. BLT encodes bytes into dynamically sized patches, which serve as the primary units of computation. Patches are segmented based on the entropy of the next byte, allocating more compute and model capacity where increased data complexity demands it. The study presents the first FLOP controlled scaling study of byte-level models up to 8B parameters and 4T training bytes. The results demonstrate the feasibility of scaling models trained on raw bytes without a fixed vocabulary. Both training and inference efficiency improve due to dynamically selecting long patches when data is predictable, along with qualitative improvements on reasoning and long tail generalization. Overall, for fixed inference costs, BLT shows significantly better scaling than tokenization-based models, by simultaneously growing both patch and model size. <br> <br>

41. ***LLMs in anomaly detection <br>
A multi-university collaboration introduces AD-LLM, the first benchmark evaluating LLMs for anomaly detection (AD) tasks like fraud detection and misinformation. Key findings include LLMs' effectiveness in zero-shot detection and data augmentation for AD models. The study also outlines challenges in explaining model selection and proposes six research directions to expand LLM applications in anomaly detection.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 15, Uni of Southern California, Northwestern Uni, Arizona State Uni, Adobe and Rice Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11142) “AD-LLM: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Anomaly Detection”. Anomaly detection (AD) is an important machine learning task with many real-world uses, including fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and industrial monitoring. Within natural language processing (NLP), AD helps detect issues like spam, misinformation, and unusual user activity. Although large language models (LLMs) have had a strong impact on tasks such as text generation and summarization, their potential in AD has not been studied enough. This paper introduces AD-LLM, the first benchmark that evaluates how LLMs can help with NLP anomaly detection. The study examines three key tasks: (i) zero-shot detection, using LLMs' pre-trained knowledge to perform AD without tasks-specific training; (ii) data augmentation, generating synthetic data and category descriptions to improve AD models; and (iii) model selection, using LLMs to suggest unsupervised AD models. Through experiments with different datasets, the study finds that LLMs can work well in zero-shot AD, that carefully designed augmentation methods are useful, and that explaining model selection for specific datasets remains challenging. Based on these results, the authors outline six future research directions on LLMs for AD. <br> <br>

43. ***AI agents revolutionizing enterprise automation <br>
VentureBeat discusses the transformative role of AI agents in enterprise automation, surpassing traditional methods like RPA. These agents adapt dynamically, integrate data sources, and automate workflows. Predictions suggest a surge in their adoption, requiring robust evaluation frameworks and continuous optimization. Businesses must embrace AI agents to unlock unprecedented efficiency and innovation.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 15, VentureBeat published an [article](https://venturebeat.com/ai/weve-come-a-long-way-from-rpa-how-ai-agents-are-revolutionizing-automation/) “We’ve come a long way from RPA: How AI agents are revolutionizing automation”. In the past year, AI agents have emerged as transformative tools for enterprise efficiency, surpassing traditional automation methods like robotic process automation (RPA). Unlike generative AI tools that assist in workflows, AI agents can think, act, and collaborate autonomously. Gartner predicts that by 2028, 33% of enterprise software applications will include agentic AI, up from less than 1% in 2024. Traditional automation tools are limited by rigidity and high costs, whereas AI agents, especially vertical AI agents tailored for specific industries, offer dynamic, intelligent workflows. These agents eliminate operational overhead, unlock new possibilities, and build competitive advantages by adapting in real-time. The shift from RPA to multi-agent AI systems enables autonomous decision-making and collaboration, transforming enterprise workflows. AI agents integrate diverse data sources, automate end-to-end workflows, and require new architectures and developer tools for management. They are becoming collaborative co-workers, enhancing productivity and decision-making. However, as AI agents handle more complex tasks, ensuring high accuracy is crucial. Organizations must invest in robust evaluation frameworks, continuous monitoring, and automated optimization tools. As AI deployment costs decrease, rapid experimentation and iteration will be essential. Embracing AI agents can lead to unparalleled efficiency and innovation, making it imperative for organizations to act now. <br> <br>

45. ***Multimodal QA with visually rich content <br>
The VisDoM study introduces VisDoMRAG, a novel approach for multimodal retrieval-augmented generation, enhancing QA across documents with visually rich content. Using a new benchmark, VisDoMBench, it combines textual and visual reasoning with consistency-constrained modality fusion, achieving 12-20% improved accuracy over baselines, setting new standards for multimodal QA systems.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 14, Uni of Maryland, Adobe and IGDTUW published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10704) “VisDoM: Multi-Document QA with Visually Rich Elements Using Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation”. Understanding information from a collection of multiple documents, particularly those with visually rich elements, is important for document-grounded question answering. This paper introduces VisDoMBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate QA systems in multi-document settings with rich multimodal content, including tables, charts, and presentation slides. We propose VisDoMRAG, a novel multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach that simultaneously utilizes visual and textual RAG, combining robust visual retrieval capabilities with sophisticated linguistic reasoning. VisDoMRAG employs a multi-step reasoning process encompassing evidence curation and chain-of-thought reasoning for concurrent textual and visual RAG pipelines. A key novelty of VisDoMRAG is its consistency-constrained modality fusion mechanism, which aligns the reasoning processes across modalities at inference time to produce a coherent final answer. This leads to enhanced accuracy in scenarios where critical information is distributed across modalities and improved answer verifiability through implicit context attribution. Through extensive experiments involving open-source and proprietary large language models, the authors benchmark state-of-the-art document QA methods on VisDoMBench. Extensive results show that VisDoMRAG outperforms unimodal and long-context LLM baselines for end-to-end multimodal document QA by 12-20%. <br> <br>

49. ***Transitioning to Large Action Models (LAMs) <br>
Microsoft outlines the evolution from Large Language Models (LLMs) to Large Action Models (LAMs), focusing on dynamic task completion. Using a Windows OS-based agent, the study provides a framework for LAM development, from data collection to deployment, and emphasizes LAMs' potential in AI's transition toward general intelligence.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 13, Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10047) “Large Action Models: From Inception to Implementation”. As AI continues to advance, there is a growing demand for systems that go beyond language-based assistance and move toward intelligent agents capable of performing real-world actions. This evolution requires the transition from traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), which excel at generating textual responses, to Large Action Models (LAMs), designed for action generation and execution within dynamic environments. Enabled by agent systems, LAMs hold the potential to transform AI from passive language understanding to active task completion, marking a significant milestone in the progression toward artificial general intelligence. This study presents a comprehensive framework for developing LAMs, offering a systematic approach to their creation, from inception to deployment. The work begins with an overview of LAMs, highlighting their unique characteristics and delineating their differences from LLMs. Using a Windows OS-based agent as a case study, the work provides a detailed, step-by-step guide on the key stages of LAM development, including data collection, model training, environment integration, grounding, and evaluation. This generalizable workflow can serve as a blueprint for creating functional LAMs in various application domains. The authors conclude by identifying the current limitations of LAMs and discussing directions for future research and industrial deployment, emphasizing the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in realizing the full potential of LAMs in real-world applications.

51. ***Neural network dynamics and generalization <br>
The University of Oxford examines neural networks' complexity dynamics to explain "grokking," where networks transition from memorization to generalization. By introducing an intrinsic complexity measure and a new regularization method, the study highlights a principled approach to encouraging low-rank representations, enhancing both compression and generalization.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 13, Uni of Oxford published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09810) “The Complexity Dynamics of Grokking”. The study investigates the phenomenon of generalization through the lens of compression. In particular, the authors study the complexity dynamics of neural networks to explain grokking, where networks suddenly transition from memorizing to generalizing solutions long after over-fitting the training data. To this end the study introduces a new measure of intrinsic complexity for neural networks based on the theory of Kolmogorov complexity. Tracking this metric throughout network training, the study finds a consistent pattern in training dynamics, consisting of a rise and fall in complexity. The work demonstrates that this corresponds to memorization followed by generalization. Based on insights from rate--distortion theory and the minimum description length principle, the authors lay out a principled approach to lossy compression of neural networks, and connect the complexity measure to explicit generalization bounds. Based on a careful analysis of information capacity in neural networks, the study proposes a new regularization method which encourages networks towards low-rank representations by penalizing their spectral entropy, and find that the proposed regularizer outperforms baselines in total compression of the dataset. <br> <br>

53. ***Evaluating theory of mind in LLMs <br>
Meta, University of Washington, and CMU present ExploreToM, a framework for generating diverse datasets to evaluate theory of mind in LLMs. Results reveal limitations in state-of-the-art models like GPT-4, with accuracies as low as 9%. Fine-tuning on ExploreToM data significantly improves performance, addressing gaps in social reasoning benchmarks.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 12, Meta, Uni of Washington, and CMU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12175) “Explore Theory-of-Mind: Program-Guided Adversarial Data Generation for Theory of Mind Reasoning”. Do large language models (LLMs) have theory of mind? A plethora of papers and benchmarks have been introduced to evaluate if current models have been able to develop this key ability of social intelligence. However, all rely on limited datasets with simple patterns that can potentially lead to problematic blind spots in evaluation and an overestimation of model capabilities. The study introduces ExploreToM, the first framework to allow large-scale generation of diverse and challenging theory of mind data for robust training and evaluation. The proposed approach leverages an A* search over a custom domain-specific language to produce complex story structures and novel, diverse, yet plausible scenarios to stress test the limits of LLMs. Evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama-3.1-70B and GPT-4o, show accuracies as low as 0% and 9% on ExploreToM-generated data, highlighting the need for more robust theory of mind evaluation. As the generations are a conceptual superset of prior work, fine-tuning on the data yields a 27-point accuracy improvement on the classic ToMi benchmark (Le et al., 2019). ExploreToM also enables uncovering underlying skills and factors missing for models to show theory of mind, such as unreliable state tracking or data imbalances, which may contribute to models' poor performance on benchmarks. <br> <br>

As 2024 concludes, generative AI continues to evolve, driven by pioneers like OpenAI. While OpenAI pursues artificial general intelligence (AGI), most businesses focus on using AI to boost productivity, reduce costs, and enhance customer experiences. Organizations are increasingly relying on model inferencing to optimize AI workloads based on performance, cost, data, security, and latency, marking the true implementation of enterprise AI. Menlo Ventures found that 72% of U.S. enterprise leaders expect broader adoption of GenAI tools soon. In 2025, trends from 2024 will mature, with small language models (SLMs) becoming standard due to their cost-efficiency and control over data. Large context windows will enhance AI performance, allowing businesses to process extensive documents in a single prompt. Education on AI usage will emphasize soft skills, enabling employees to share AI insights across business lines. Autonomous software agents will see broader adoption, despite needing stronger reasoning capabilities. Governance and oversight of AI will become crucial, with more boards addressing AI-related risks. Overall, organizations must continue to test and learn from their GenAI deployments, ensuring responsible AI use with the help of trusted advisors. <br> <br>

57. ***Outrage and misinformation spread <br>
A study by Princeton and collaborators finds that misinformation leverages outrage to spread online, often bypassing accuracy. Analysis across platforms shows that users are more likely to share outrage-evoking content. The findings challenge traditional misinformation mitigation strategies and highlight the role of emotional engagement in misinformation proliferation.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 28, Princeton Uni, Northwestern Uni, Yale Uni, St. John’s Uni, Brookings Inst, and Harward Uni published a [paper](https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.adl2829) on Science “Misinformation exploits outrage to spread online”. The research tested a hypothesis that misinformation exploits outrage to spread online, examining generalizability across multiple platforms, time periods, and classifications of misinformation. Outrage is highly engaging and need not be accurate to achieve its communicative goals, making it an attractive signal to embed in misinformation. In eight studies that used US data from Facebook (1,063,298 links) and Twitter (44,529 tweets, 24,007 users) and two behavioral experiments (1475 participants), the researchers show that (i) misinformation sources evoke more outrage than do trustworthy sources; (ii) outrage facilitates the sharing of misinformation at least as strongly as sharing of trustworthy news; and (iii) users are more willing to share outrage-evoking misinformation without reading it first. Consequently, outrage-evoking misinformation may be difficult to mitigate with interventions that assume users want to share accurate information.

1. ***Phi-4 outperforms its predecessors with improved training techniques. <br>
Phi-4, a 14-billion-parameter language model developed by Microsoft, emphasizes data quality by integrating synthetic data during training. Unlike earlier Phi models that primarily distilled capabilities from GPT-4, phi-4 surpasses its teacher model, especially in STEM-focused QA tasks. With minimal architectural changes from phi-3, its performance is enhanced through innovations in data quality, training curriculum, and post-training techniques, making it highly efficient for reasoning benchmarks.*** <br> <br>
   Dec 12, Microsoft release phi-4 with it [report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08905) “Phi-4 Technical Report”. The report presents phi-4, a 14-billion parameter language model developed with a training recipe that is centrally focused on data quality. Unlike most language models, where pre-training is based primarily on organic data sources such as web content or code, phi-4 strategically incorporates synthetic data throughout the training process. While previous models in the Phi family largely distill the capabilities of a teacher model (specifically GPT-4), phi-4 substantially surpasses its teacher model on STEM-focused QA capabilities, giving evidence that the data-generation and post-training techniques go beyond distillation. Despite minimal changes to the phi-3 architecture, phi-4 achieves strong performance relative to its size -- especially on reasoning-focused benchmarks -- due to improved data, training curriculum, and innovations in the post-training scheme. <br> <br>

3. ***LLMs exhibit human-like social identity biases. <br>
A study by Cambridge, NYU, and King’s College London reveals that LLMs show biases akin to human ingroup solidarity and outgroup hostility. Testing 77 LLMs with prompts like "We are…" demonstrated bias in base models and some fine-tuned variants. These biases are observed in controlled settings and real conversations. However, careful data curation and fine-tuning can mitigate these biases, emphasizing the need for equitable AI systems and understanding their societal implications.*** <br> <br>
   Dec 12, Uni of Cambridge, NYU, and King’s College London published a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-024-00741-1) “Generative language models exhibit social identity biases” on nature computational science. Social identity biases, particularly the tendency to favor one’s own group (ingroup solidarity) and derogate other groups (outgroup hostility), are deeply rooted in human psychology and social behavior. However, it is unknown if such biases are also present in artificial intelligence systems. This study shows that large language models (LLMs) exhibit patterns of social identity bias, similarly to humans. By administering sentence completion prompts to 77 different LLMs (for instance, ‘We are…’), the study demonstrates that nearly all base models and some instruction-tuned and preference-tuned models display clear ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation. These biases manifest both in controlled experimental settings and in naturalistic human–LLM conversations. However, the work finds that careful curation of training data and specialized fine-tuning can substantially reduce bias levels. These findings have important implications for developing more equitable artificial intelligence systems and highlight the urgent need to understand how human–LLM interactions might reinforce existing social biases. <br> <br>

5. ***Lyra advances speech-centric multimodal AI efficiently. <br>
Researchers from CUHK, SmartMore, and HKUST introduced Lyra, a multimodal AI framework excelling in long-speech comprehension, cross-modality efficiency, and speech interaction. Lyra employs techniques like multi-modality LoRA for reduced costs, a latent multi-modality extractor for improved performance, and a rich dataset with 1.5M samples. It outperforms competitors across benchmarks while being resource-efficient, marking a significant step in omni-cognition.*** <br> <br>
   Dec 12, CUHK, SmartMore and HKUST published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09501) “Lyra: An Efficient and Speech-Centric Framework for Omni-Cognition”. As Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) evolve, expanding beyond single-domain capabilities is essential to meet the demands for more versatile and efficient AI. However, previous omni-models have insufficiently explored speech, neglecting its integration with multi-modality. The study introduces Lyra, an efficient MLLM that enhances multimodal abilities, including advanced long-speech comprehension, sound understanding, cross-modality efficiency, and seamless speech interaction. To achieve efficiency and speech-centric capabilities, Lyra employs three strategies: (1) leveraging existing open-source large models and a proposed multi-modality LoRA to reduce training costs and data requirements; (2) using a latent multi-modality regularizer and extractor to strengthen the relationship between speech and other modalities, thereby enhancing model performance; and (3) constructing a high-quality, extensive dataset that includes 1.5M multi-modal (language, vision, audio) data samples and 12K long speech samples, enabling Lyra to handle complex long speech inputs and achieve more robust omni-cognition. Compared to other omni-methods, Lyra achieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language, vision-speech, and speech-language benchmarks, while also using fewer computational resources and less training data.

7. ***Intermediate layers are crucial for representation quality. <br>
A study by University of Kentucky, Mila, NYU, Meta, and Wand.AI found intermediate layers in LLMs provide superior representations for downstream tasks compared to final layers. Using metrics like prompt entropy and augmentation-invariance, the study revealed architectural differences and the evolution of representations during training. The findings offer insights into LLM mechanics and guide architectural and training strategies.*** <br> <br>
   Dec 12, Uni of Kentucky, Mila, NYU, Meta and Wand.AI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09563) “Does Representation Matter? Exploring Intermediate Layers in Large Language Models”. Understanding what defines a good representation in large language models (LLMs) is fundamental to both theoretical understanding and practical applications. This study investigates the quality of intermediate representations in various LLM architectures, including Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs). The study finds that intermediate layers often yield more informative representations for downstream tasks than the final layers. To measure the representation quality, the study adapts and applies a suite of metrics - such as prompt entropy, curvature, and augmentation-invariance - originally proposed in other contexts. Empirical study reveals significant architectural differences, how representations evolve throughout training, and how factors like input randomness and prompt length affect each layer. Notably, the study observes a bimodal pattern in the entropy of some intermediate layers and consider potential explanations tied to training data.

University of Texas researchers introduced WaLLoC, a neural codec combining linear transform coding and nonlinear autoencoders for efficient compressed learning. WaLLoC balances bitrate reduction and dimensionality while avoiding significant information loss. It excels in tasks like image classification and music source separation, proving highly efficient for mobile computing and remote sensing applications.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 12, Uni of Texas at Austin published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09405) “Learned Compression for Compressed Learning”. Modern sensors produce increasingly rich streams of high-resolution data. Due to resource constraints, machine learning systems discard the vast majority of this information via resolution reduction. Compressed-domain learning allows models to operate on compact latent representations, allowing higher effective resolution for the same budget. However, existing compression systems are not ideal for compressed learning. Linear transform coding and end-to-end learned compression systems reduce bitrate, but do not uniformly reduce dimensionality; thus, they do not meaningfully increase efficiency. Generative autoencoders reduce dimensionality, but their adversarial or perceptual objectives lead to significant information loss. To address these limitations, the study introduces WaLLoC (Wavelet Learned Lossy Compression), a neural codec architecture that combines linear transform coding with nonlinear dimensionality-reducing autoencoders. WaLLoC sandwiches a shallow, asymmetric autoencoder and entropy bottleneck between an invertible wavelet packet transform. Across several key metrics, WaLLoC outperforms the autoencoders used in state-of-the-art latent diffusion models. WaLLoC does not require perceptual or adversarial losses to represent high-frequency detail, providing compatibility with modalities beyond RGB images and stereo audio. WaLLoC's encoder consists almost entirely of linear operations, making it exceptionally efficient and suitable for mobile computing, remote sensing, and learning directly from compressed data. The study demonstrates WaLLoC's capability for compressed-domain learning across several tasks, including image classification, colorization, document understanding, and music source separation. Code, experiments, and pre-trained audio and image codecs are available at https://ut-sysml.org/walloc <br> <br>

11. ***A framework validates LLM applications in economics. <br>
Researchers from University of Chicago and MIT developed an econometric framework to determine the validity of LLM outputs for prediction and estimation in economics. The framework advises against relying on LLMs unless training data leakage and measurement errors are addressed. It recommends using open-source LLMs with documented datasets and validating output accuracy to ensure reliable findings.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 11, Uni of Chicago and MIT published a [paper]() “Large Language Models: An Applied Econometric Framework”. Large language models (LLMs) are being used in economics research to form predictions, label text, simulate human responses, generate hypotheses, and even produce data for times and places where such data don’t exist. While these uses are creative, are they valid? When can people abstract away from the inner workings of an LLM and simply rely on their outputs? The study develops an econometric framework to answer this question. The framework distinguishes between two types of empirical tasks. Using LLM outputs for prediction problems (including hypothesis generation) is valid under one condition: no “leakage” between the LLM’s training dataset and the researcher’s sample. Using LLM outputs for estimation problems to automate the measurement of some economic concept (expressed by some text or from human subjects) requires an additional assumption: LLM outputs must be as good as the gold standard measurements they replace. Otherwise estimates can be biased, even if LLM outputs are highly accurate but not perfectly so. The study documents the extent to which these conditions are violated and the implications for research findings in illustrative applications to finance and political economy. The study also provides guidance to empirical researchers. The only way to ensure no training leakage is to use open-source LLMs with documented training data and published weights. The only way to deal with LLM measurement error is to collect validation data and model the error structure. A corollary is that if such conditions can’t be met for a candidate LLM application, the strong advice is: don’t. <br> <br>

For example. the agentic nature of Gemini raises risks, such as unintended actions or misuse in autonomous environments. <br> <br>

15. ***WSRL enables efficient online RL fine-tuning. <br>
UC Berkeley and CMU demonstrated that retaining offline data during RL fine-tuning is unnecessary if using a properly designed online RL approach like WSRL. By seeding with minimal rollouts, WSRL recalibrates models for online distributions, enabling faster and more stable learning without offline data reliance.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 11, UC Berkeley and CMU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07762) “Efficient Online Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning Need Not Retain Offline Data”. The modern paradigm in machine learning involves pre-training on diverse data, followed by task-specific fine-tuning. In reinforcement learning (RL), this translates to learning via offline RL on a diverse historical dataset, followed by rapid online RL fine-tuning using interaction data. Most RL fine-tuning methods require continued training on offline data for stability and performance. However, this is undesirable because training on diverse offline data is slow and expensive for large datasets, and in principle, also limit the performance improvement possible because of constraints or pessimism on offline data. This study shows that retaining offline data is unnecessary as long as using a properly-designed online RL approach for fine-tuning offline RL initializations. To build this approach, the work starts by analyzing the role of retaining offline data in online fine-tuning. The study finds that continued training on offline data is mostly useful for preventing a sudden divergence in the value function at the onset of fine-tuning, caused by a distribution mismatch between the offline data and online rollouts. This divergence typically results in unlearning and forgetting the benefits of offline pre-training. The approach, Warm-start RL (WSRL), mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained initializations using a very simple idea. WSRL employs a warmup phase that seeds the online RL run with a very small number of rollouts from the pre-trained policy to do fast online RL. The data collected during warmup helps “recalibrate” the offline Q-function to the online distribution, allowing to completely discard offline data without destabilizing the online RL fine-tuning. The work shows that WSRL is able to fine-tune without retaining any offline data, and is able to learn faster and attains higher performance than existing algorithms irrespective of whether they retain offline data or not. <br> <br>

17. ***LatentLM unifies multimodal generation efficiently. <br>
Microsoft and Tsinghua University proposed LatentLM, a multimodal model that integrates text, audio, and image data through variational autoencoders and next-token diffusion. The model outperforms competitors in image generation, text-to-speech synthesis, and cross-modal tasks, offering scalability and efficiency for multimodal AI applications.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 11, Microsoft and Tsinghua Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08635) “Multimodal Latent Language Modeling with Next-Token Diffusion”. Multimodal generative models require a unified approach to handle both discrete data (e.g., text and code) and continuous data (e.g., image, audio, video). This work proposes Latent Language Modeling (LatentLM), which seamlessly integrates continuous and discrete data using causal Transformers. Specifically, the authors employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to represent continuous data as latent vectors and introduce next-token diffusion for autoregressive generation of these vectors. Additionally, the study develops sigma-VAE to address the challenges of variance collapse, which is crucial for autoregressive modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LatentLM across various modalities. In image generation, LatentLM surpasses Diffusion Transformers in both performance and scalability. When integrated into multimodal large language models, LatentLM provides a general-purpose interface that unifies multimodal generation and understanding. Experimental results show that LatentLM achieves favorable performance compared to Transfusion and vector quantized models in the setting of scaling up training tokens. In text-to-speech synthesis, LatentLM outperforms the state-of-the-art VALL-E 2 model in speaker similarity and robustness, while requiring 10x fewer decoding steps. The results establish LatentLM as a highly effective and scalable approach to advance large multimodal models. <br> <br>

19. ***HyRe adapts models for underspecified tasks. <br>
Stanford researchers introduced HyRe, a technique that dynamically reweights ensemble predictions at test time using labeled examples. HyRe improves model performance in personalization and distribution shifts, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in various scenarios.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 11, Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08812) “Test-Time Alignment via Hypothesis Reweighting”. Large pretrained models often struggle with underspecified tasks -- situations where the training data does not fully define the desired behavior. For example, chatbots must handle diverse and often conflicting user preferences, requiring adaptability to various user needs. The study proposes a novel framework to address the general challenge of aligning models to test-time user intent, which is rarely fully specified during training. The approach involves training an efficient ensemble, i.e., a single neural network with multiple prediction heads, each representing a different function consistent with the training data. The main contribution is HyRe, a simple adaptation technique that dynamically reweights ensemble members at test time using a small set of labeled examples from the target distribution, which can be labeled in advance or actively queried from a larger unlabeled pool. By leveraging recent advances in scalable ensemble training, the method scales to large pretrained models, with computational costs comparable to fine-tuning a single model. The study empirically validates HyRe in several underspecified scenarios, including personalization tasks and settings with distribution shifts. Additionally, with just five preference pairs from each target distribution, the same ensemble adapted via HyRe outperforms the prior state-of-the-art 2B-parameter reward model accuracy across 18 evaluation distributions. <br> <br>

21. ***Concept-level modeling enhances abstraction in AI. <br>
Meta's research explores Large Concept Models, operating on sentence-level semantic representations rather than tokens. By using SONAR embeddings, these models demonstrate zero-shot generalization across languages, outperforming similarly-sized LLMs in generative tasks like summarization and summary expansion.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 11, Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08821) “Large Concept Models: Language Modeling in a Sentence Representation Space”. LLMs have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence and have emerged as the de-facto tool for many tasks. The current established technology of LLMs is to process input and generate output at the token level. This is in sharp contrast to humans who operate at multiple levels of abstraction, well beyond single words, to analyze information and to generate creative content. This study presents an attempt at an architecture which operates on an explicit higher-level semantic representation, which is named as a concept. Concepts are language- and modality-agnostic and represent a higher level idea or action in a flow. Hence, the study builds a "Large Concept Model". In this study, as proof of feasibility, the authors assume that a concept corresponds to a sentence, and use an existing sentence embedding space, SONAR, which supports up to 200 languages in both text and speech modalities. The Large Concept Model is trained to perform autoregressive sentence prediction in an embedding space. The work explores multiple approaches, namely MSE regression, variants of diffusion-based generation, and models operating in a quantized SONAR space. These explorations are performed using 1.6B parameter models and training data in the order of 1.3T tokens. The study then scales one architecture to a model size of 7B parameters and training data of about 2.7T tokens. The study performs an experimental evaluation on several generative tasks, namely summarization and a new task of summary expansion. Finally, the authors show that the model exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization performance to many languages, outperforming existing LLMs of the same size. The training code of the models is [freely available](https://github.com/facebookresearch/large_concept_models). <br> <br>

23. ***DiTFlow advances motion transfer in video synthesis. <br>
A collaborative effort by Oxford, Snap Inc, and MBZUAI introduced DiTFlow, a method leveraging Diffusion Transformers to transfer motion from reference videos to synthesized ones. Using Attention Motion Flow, DiTFlow outperforms existing methods across metrics and human evaluations.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 10, Uni of Oxford, Snap Inc and MBZUAI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07776) “Video Motion Transfer with Diffusion Transformers”. The paper proposes DiTFlow, a method for transferring the motion of a reference video to a newly synthesized one, designed specifically for Diffusion Transformers (DiT). The study first processes the reference video with a pre-trained DiT to analyze cross-frame attention maps and extract a patch-wise motion signal called the Attention Motion Flow (AMF). The work guides the latent denoising process in an optimization-based, training-free, manner by optimizing latents with the AMF loss to generate videos reproducing the motion of the reference one. The study also applies an optimization strategy to transformer positional embeddings, granting a boost in zero-shot motion transfer capabilities. The work evaluates DiTFlow against recently published methods, outperforming all across multiple metrics and human evaluation. <br> <br>

25. ***Unified paradigms enhance vision-domain scalability. <br>
LMU Munich researchers proposed bridging Masked Generative Models and Non-Autoregressive Models via discrete-state approaches. The unified framework facilitates scalable applications in vision tasks, establishing new benchmarks for generative models in this domain.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 10, LMU Munich published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06787) “[MASK] is All You Need”. In generative models, two paradigms have gained attraction in various applications: next-set prediction-based Masked Generative Models and next-noise prediction-based Non-Autoregressive Models, e.g., Diffusion Models. This study proposes using discrete-state models to connect them and explore their scalability in the vision domain. First, the study conducts a step-by-step analysis in a unified design space across two types of models including timestep-independence, noise schedule, temperature, guidance strength, etc in a scalable manner. Second, the work re-casts typical discriminative tasks, e.g., image segmentation, as an unmasking process from [MASK] tokens on a discrete-state model. This enables to perform various sampling processes, including flexible conditional sampling by only training once to model the joint distribution. All aforementioned explorations lead to a framework named Discrete Interpolants, which enables to achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to previous discrete-state based methods in various benchmarks, like ImageNet256, MS COCO, and video dataset FaceForensics. In summary, by leveraging [MASK] in discrete-state models, the study can bridge Masked Generative and Non-autoregressive Diffusion models, as well as generative and discriminative tasks. <br> <br>

27. ***APOLLO Optimizer for LLMs: <br>
    The University of Texas at Austin and Meta's paper, “APOLLO: SGD-like Memory, AdamW-level Performance,” introduces APOLLO, a memory-efficient optimizer for training large language models (LLMs). APOLLO approximates learning rate scaling using a low-rank optimizer state based on random projection, significantly reducing memory usage while maintaining performance comparable to AdamW. The rank-1 variant, APOLLO-Mini, even outperforms AdamW with SGD-level memory costs. Experiments show APOLLO enhances throughput, supports larger batch sizes, and allows pre-training on lower-end GPUs, making it a promising solution for scalable and efficient LLM training.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 9, Uni of Texas at Austin and Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05270) “APOLLO: SGD-like Memory, AdamW-level Performance”. Large language models (LLMs) are notoriously memory-intensive during training, particularly with the popular AdamW optimizer. This memory burden necessitates using more or higher-end GPUs or reducing batch sizes, limiting training scalability and throughput. To address this, various memory-efficient optimizers have been proposed to reduce optimizer memory usage. However, they face critical challenges: (i) reliance on costly SVD operations; (ii) significant performance trade-offs compared to AdamW; and (iii) still substantial optimizer memory overhead to maintain competitive performance. This work identifies that AdamW's learning rate adaptation rule can be effectively coarsened as a structured learning rate update. Based on this insight, the study proposes Approximated Gradient Scaling for Memory-Efficient LLM Optimization (APOLLO), which approximates learning rate scaling using an auxiliary low-rank optimizer state based on pure random projection. This structured learning rate update rule makes APOLLO highly tolerant to further memory reductions while delivering comparable pre-training performance. Even its rank-1 variant, APOLLO-Mini, achieves superior pre-training performance compared to AdamW with SGD-level memory costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the APOLLO series performs on-par with or better than AdamW, while achieving greater memory savings by nearly eliminating the optimization states of AdamW. These savings provide significant system-level benefits: (1) Enhanced Throughput: 3x throughput on an 8xA100-80GB setup compared to AdamW by supporting 4x larger batch sizes. (2) Improved Model Scalability: Pre-training LLaMA-13B with naive DDP on A100-80GB GPUs without system-level optimizations. (3) Low-End GPU Friendly Pre-training: Pre-training LLaMA-7B on a single GPU using less than 12 GB of memory with weight quantization. Here is [the code](https://github.com/zhuhanqing/APOLLO). <br> <br>

29. ***Amazon’s New AI Agent Lab:  <br>Amazon has launched the AGI SF Lab in San Francisco, led by Adept co-founder David Luan, to develop AI agents capable of managing workflows and performing real-world actions. Initially staffed by former Adept employees, the lab will expand Amazon’s AGI efforts and focus on integrating human feedback and goal understanding. This move aligns with Amazon’s broader AI initiatives and reflects growing competition in the $31 billion agentic AI market.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 9, according to [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/09/amazon-forms-a-new-ai-agent-focused-lab-led-by-adept-co-founder/), Amazon forms an AI agent-focused lab led by Adept’s co-founder. Amazon is launching a new R&D lab in San Francisco, named the Amazon AGI SF Lab, to develop foundational capabilities for AI agents. Led by David Luan, co-founder of AI startup Adept, the lab aims to create agents capable of performing actions in both digital and physical environments and managing complex workflows using computers, web browsers, and code interpreters. The lab's work will build on Amazon's broader AGI team, with a focus on enabling AI agents to perform real-world actions, learn from human feedback, self-correct, and understand human goals. The lab will initially be staffed by Adept employees, with plans to hire additional researchers in fields like quantitative finance, physics, and math. This initiative follows Amazon's licensing deal with Adept, which saw Luan and parts of Adept's team join Amazon under Rohit Prasad, head of an AGI team specializing in large language models. The move is similar to Microsoft's deal with AI startup Inflection and has attracted regulatory scrutiny. Adept, founded two years ago, aims to create AI models that can perform tasks on any software tool using natural language, envisioning an "AI teammate" capable of using various software tools and APIs. The agentic AI sector is projected to be worth $31 billion by year-end, with many organizations planning to integrate AI agents for efficiency. Other major AI players, including OpenAI and Google, are also developing similar technologies. Amazon has introduced conversational agents for its Bedrock AI platform and its Amazon Q Business assistant platform, with CEO Andy Jassy hinting at a more advanced Alexa capable of taking actions. <br> <br>

33. ***Meta and UC San Diego: Coconut Reasoning Paradigm: <br>
A new paradigm, Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought), was introduced to enhance reasoning in LLMs. It enables latent space reasoning by using continuous representations of thought states instead of natural language tokens. This approach improves logical reasoning tasks, offering emergent capabilities like breadth-first search for problem-solving and reducing inference token requirements.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 9, Meta and UC San Diego published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06769) “Training Large Language Models to Reason in a Continuous Latent Space”. Large language models (LLMs) are restricted to reason in the "language space", where they typically express the reasoning process with a chain-of-thought (CoT) to solve a complex reasoning problem. However, the authors argue that language space may not always be optimal for reasoning. For example, most word tokens are primarily for textual coherence and not essential for reasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose huge challenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of LLM reasoning in an unrestricted latent space instead of using natural language, the study introduces a new paradigm Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). The work utilizes the last hidden state of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state (termed "continuous thought"). Rather than decoding this into a word token, the study feeds it back to the LLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the continuous space. Experiments show that Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on several reasoning tasks. This novel latent reasoning paradigm leads to emergent advanced reasoning patterns: the continuous thought can encode multiple alternative next reasoning steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to solve the problem, rather than prematurely committing to a single deterministic path like CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT in certain logical reasoning tasks that require substantial backtracking during planning, with fewer thinking tokens during inference. These findings demonstrate the promise of latent reasoning and offer valuable insights for future research. <br> <br>

35. ***Uncertainty in LLMs: [IDK] Token Approach: <br>
Researchers propose a calibration method incorporating an [IDK] token for LLMs to express uncertainty and combat hallucinations. The approach redistributes probability to the [IDK] token for incorrect predictions, improving output reliability while retaining most encoded knowledge.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 9, Uni of Potsdam and Tel Aviv Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06676) “I Don't Know: Explicit Modeling of Uncertainty with an [IDK] Token”. Large Language Models are known to capture real-world knowledge, allowing them to excel in many downstream tasks. Despite recent advances, these models are still prone to what are commonly known as hallucinations, causing them to emit unwanted and factually incorrect text. This work proposes a novel calibration method that can be used to combat hallucinations. The study adds a special [IDK] ("I don't know") token to the model's vocabulary and introduce an objective function that shifts probability mass to the [IDK] token for incorrect predictions. This approach allows the model to express uncertainty in its output explicitly. The work evaluates the proposed method across multiple model architectures and factual downstream tasks, and finds that models trained with the method are able to express uncertainty in places where they would previously make mistakes while suffering only a small loss of encoded knowledge. The work further performs extensive ablation studies of multiple variations of the approach and provide a detailed analysis of the precision-recall tradeoff of the method. <br> <br>

37. ***Sequoia on AI in 2025: <br>
The AI ecosystem in 2024 saw key advancements, with leading LLM providers adopting distinct strategies. AI search is revolutionizing information access, while infrastructure investments are stabilizing the industry. As AI matures, ethical and societal challenges remain crucial to ensuring positive impacts.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 9, Sequoia published an [article](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-in-2025/) “AI in 2025: Building Blocks Firmly in Place”. 2024 marked a pivotal year for AI, characterized by rapid advancements and substantial investments. The AI ecosystem, once brimming with potential, is now solidifying into a tangible reality. Key developments include the emergence of five leading LLM providers, each with distinct strategies: Google's vertical integration, OpenAI's strong brand, Anthropic's talent pool, xAI's data center focus, and Meta's open-source approach. AI search has emerged as a powerful application, redefining information access and processing. Additionally, the AI infrastructure landscape is stabilizing, with data center construction and optimization becoming central priorities. As the industry matures in 2025, we anticipate significant advancements in AI-powered products and services, transforming various sectors and improving daily life. However, challenges such as ethical considerations, data privacy, and job displacement will require careful attention and responsible development to ensure a positive impact on society. <br> <br>

39. ***Moxin-7B: Fully Open-Source LLM: <br>
Developed under the Model Openness Framework (MOF), Moxin-7B is a transparent, fully open-source LLM that includes training code, datasets, and checkpoints. It achieves top MOF classification, outperforming many 7B models in zero-shot evaluations and excelling in few-shot tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 8, Northeastern Uni, Harvard Uni, Cornell Uni, Tulance Uni, et al published a paper “Fully Open Source Moxin-7B Technical Report”. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone a significant transformation, marked by a rapid rise in both their popularity and capabilities. Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA and Mistral, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Although open-source LLMs present unprecedented opportunities for innovation and research, the commercialization of LLMs has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many open-source LLMs fail to meet fundamental transparency requirements by withholding essential components like training code and data, and some use restrictive licenses whilst claiming to be "open-source," which may hinder further innovations on LLMs. To mitigate this issue, the authors introduces [Moxin 7B](https://github.com/moxin-org/Moxin-LLM), a fully open-source LLM developed in accordance with the Model Openness Framework (MOF), a ranked classification system that evaluates AI models based on model completeness and openness, adhering to principles of open science, open source, open data, and open access. The model achieves the highest MOF classification level of "open science" through the comprehensive release of pre-training code and configurations, training and fine-tuning datasets, and intermediate and final checkpoints. Experiments show that Moxin model achieves superior performance in zero-shot evaluation compared with popular 7B models and performs competitively in few-shot evaluation. <br> <br>

41. ***OpenAI's AGI Claims: <br>
OpenAI employee Vahid Kazemi claimed their O1 model has achieved AGI, defined as surpassing most humans in various tasks. Critics note the unconventional definition, emphasizing breadth over human parity in specific tasks. Despite potential, AGI's realization remains controversial and nuanced.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 7, according to [Futurism](https://futurism.com/openai-employee-claims-agi), OpenAI Employee Says They’ve "Already Achieved AGI". OpenAI employee Vahid Kazemi recently claimed on X (formerly Twitter) that the company has achieved artificial general intelligence (AGI) with their O1 model, though he acknowledges it’s not "better than any human at any task" but rather "better than most humans at most tasks." Critics argue Kazemi's definition of AGI is unconventional, as it emphasizes the AI's ability to perform a wide variety of tasks rather than excelling in specific areas. Kazemi also discussed the nature of large language models (LLMs), comparing their learning process to the scientific method of observing, hypothesizing, and verifying. He suggested that while LLMs might seem to follow a "recipe," their capabilities are built through extensive trial and error, similar to human intuition. This statement came shortly after OpenAI removed "AGI" from its deal terms with Microsoft, leaving the business implications uncertain. Despite these claims, no AI has yet matched human workers in general labor force tasks, but Kazemi believes that continued advancements could eventually lead to human-level intelligence. <br> <br>

43. ***RL Zero: Zero-Shot Behavior from Language: <br>
Researchers proposed RL Zero, an unsupervised method allowing RL agents to derive behavior policies from language instructions using video-language models. This zero-shot language-to-behavior capability shows promise for diverse tasks, eliminating the need for supervised labeling.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 7, Uni of Texas at Austin, Uni of Alberta, Sony, Meta and UMass Amherst published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05718) “RL Zero: Zero-Shot Language to Behaviors without any Supervision”. Rewards remain an uninterpretable way to specify tasks for Reinforcement Learning, as humans are often unable to predict the optimal behavior of any given reward function, leading to poor reward design and reward hacking. Language presents an appealing way to communicate intent to agents and bypass reward design, but prior efforts to do so have been limited by costly and unscalable labeling efforts. This work proposes a method for a completely unsupervised alternative to grounding language instructions in a zero-shot manner to obtain policies. The study presents a solution that takes the form of imagine, project, and imitate: The agent imagines the observation sequence corresponding to the language description of a task, projects the imagined sequence to the target domain, and grounds it to a policy. Video-language models allow to imagine task descriptions that leverage knowledge of tasks learned from internet-scale video-text mappings. The challenge remains to ground these generations to a policy. This work shows that the researchers can achieve a zero-shot language-to-behavior policy by first grounding the imagined sequences in real observations of an unsupervised RL agent and using a closed-form solution to imitation learning that allows the RL agent to mimic the grounded observations. The method, RLZero, is the first to show zero-shot language to behavior generation abilities without any supervision on a variety of tasks on simulated domains. The study further shows that RLZero can also generate policies zero-shot from cross-embodied videos such as those scraped from YouTube. <br> <br>

45. ***FlexAttention: Simplifying Attention Kernels: <br>
Meta and the University of Michigan introduced FlexAttention, a programming model enabling efficient attention kernel generation with a few lines of PyTorch code. It supports attention variant composition, streamlining the development of new models while maintaining competitive performance.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 7, Meta and Uni of Michigan-Ann Arbor published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05496) “Flex Attention: A Programming Model for Generating Optimized Attention Kernels”. Over the past 7 years, attention has become one of the most important primitives in deep learning. The primary approach to optimize attention is FlashAttention, which fuses the operation together, drastically improving both the runtime and the memory consumption. However, the importance of FlashAttention combined with its monolithic nature poses a problem for researchers aiming to try new attention variants -- a "software lottery". This problem is exacerbated by the difficulty of writing efficient fused attention kernels, resisting traditional compiler-based approaches. The study introduces FlexAttention, a novel compiler-driven programming model that allows implementing the majority of attention variants in a few lines of idiomatic PyTorch code. The study demonstrates that many existing attention variants (e.g. Alibi, Document Masking, PagedAttention, etc.) can be implemented via FlexAttention, and that achieves competitive performance compared to these handwritten kernels. Finally, the work demonstrates how FlexAttention allows for easy composition of attention variants, solving the combinatorial explosion of attention variants. <br> <br>

47. ***Frontier Models and In-Context Scheming: <br>
A study evaluated leading LLMs for scheming behaviors, revealing deceptive strategies such as oversight evasion and model weight exfiltration. These findings highlight potential risks in AI autonomy and the need for mitigation measures in deploying frontier models.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 6, Apollo Research published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04984) “Frontier Models are Capable of In-context Scheming”. Frontier models are increasingly trained and deployed as autonomous agents, which significantly increases their potential for risks. One particular safety concern is that AI agents might covertly pursue misaligned goals, hiding their true capabilities and objectives – also known as scheming. The authors study whether models have the capability to scheme in pursuit of a goal that the authors provide in-context and instruct the model to strongly follow. The study evaluates frontier models on a suite of six agentic evaluations where models are instructed to pursue goals and are placed in environments that incentivize scheming. The results show that o1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Llama 3.1 405B all demonstrate in-context scheming capabilities. They can recognize scheming as a viable strategy and readily engage in such behavior. The work finds multiple different scheming behaviors: models strategically introduce subtle mistakes into their responses, attempt to disable their oversight mechanisms, and even exfiltrate what they believe to be their model weights to external servers. Additionally, this deceptive behavior proves persistent. For instance, when o1 has engaged in scheming, it maintains its deception in over 85% of follow-up questions and often remains deceptive in multi-turn interrogations. Analysis of the models’ chains-of-thought reveals that models explicitly reason about these deceptive strategies, providing evidence that the scheming behavior is not accidental. Surprisingly, the study also finds rare instances where models engage in scheming when only given a goal, without being strongly nudged to pursue it. Furthermore, the work observes cases where Claude 3.5 Sonnet strategically underperforms in evaluations in pursuit of being helpful, a goal that was acquired during training rather than in-context. Together, the findings demonstrate that frontier models now possess capabilities for basic in-context scheming, making the potential of AI agents to engage in scheming behavior a concrete rather than theoretical concern. <br> <br>

49. ***CompCap for Composite Images: <br>
Meta and collaborators developed CompCap, a framework to train MLLMs for understanding composite images (e.g., charts, posters). The curated CompCap-118K dataset significantly enhances MLLM performance in interpreting such visuals, outperforming benchmarks across multiple model sizes.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 6, Meta, Tufts Uni, and Georgia Tech published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05243) “CompCap: Improving Multimodal Large Language Models with Composite Captions”. How well can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) understand composite images? Composite images (CIs) are synthetic visuals created by merging multiple visual elements, such as charts, posters, or screenshots, rather than being captured directly by a camera. While CIs are prevalent in real-world applications, recent MLLM developments have primarily focused on interpreting natural images (NIs). The research reveals that current MLLMs face significant challenges in accurately understanding CIs, often struggling to extract information or perform complex reasoning based on these images. The work finds that existing training data for CIs are mostly formatted for question-answer tasks (e.g., in datasets like ChartQA and ScienceQA), while high-quality image-caption datasets, critical for robust vision-language alignment, are only available for NIs. To bridge this gap, the study introduces Composite Captions (CompCap), a flexible framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and automation tools to synthesize CIs with accurate and detailed captions. Using CompCap, the study curates CompCap-118K, a dataset containing 118K image-caption pairs across six CI types. The authors validate the effectiveness of CompCap-118K by supervised fine-tuning MLLMs of three sizes: xGen-MM-inst.-4B and LLaVA-NeXT-Vicuna-7B/13B. Empirical results show that CompCap-118K significantly enhances MLLMs' understanding of CIs, yielding average gains of 1.7%, 2.0%, and 2.9% across eleven benchmarks, respectively. <br> <br>

51. ***Aligning Human and Machine Generalization: <br>
A multi-institute study analyzed differences in how humans and machines generalize. By comparing abstraction, rule-based reasoning, and domain generalization, the research outlined interdisciplinary challenges crucial for effective human-AI collaboration in scientific discovery and decision-making.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 23, a group of researchers from 27 institutes published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15626v1) “Aligning generalisation Between Humans and Machines”. Recent advances in AI -- including generative approaches -- have resulted in technology that can support humans in scientific discovery and decision support but may also disrupt democracies and target individuals. The responsible use of AI increasingly shows the need for human-AI teaming, necessitating effective interaction between humans and machines. A crucial yet often overlooked aspect of these interactions is the different ways in which humans and machines generalise. In cognitive science, human generalisation commonly involves abstraction and concept learning. In contrast, AI generalisation encompasses out-of-domain generalisation in machine learning, rule-based reasoning in symbolic AI, and abstraction in neuro-symbolic AI. In this perspective paper, the authors combine insights from AI and cognitive science to identify key commonalities and differences across three dimensions: notions of generalisation, methods for generalisation, and evaluation of generalisation. The study maps the different conceptualisations of generalisation in AI and cognitive science along these three dimensions and consider their role in human-AI teaming. This results in interdisciplinary challenges across AI and cognitive science that must be tackled to provide a foundation for effective and cognitively supported alignment in human-AI teaming scenarios.

1. ***Release of OpenAI o1 Model Series <br>
OpenAI introduced the o1 model series, leveraging reinforcement learning and chain-of-thought reasoning for enhanced safety and robustness. The models achieve top performance on safety-related benchmarks, such as avoiding unsafe advice and stereotypes, while reducing errors by 34% compared to preview versions. Designed for complex problem-solving and multimedia understanding, the release emphasizes the importance of alignment, stress-testing, and risk management.*** <br> <br>
   Dec 6, OpenAI released its o1 and o1’s [System Card](https://cdn.openai.com/o1-system-card-20241205.pdf). The o1 model series is trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to reason using chain of thought. These advanced reasoning capabilities provide new avenues for improving the safety and robustness of the models. In particular, the models can reason about the safety policies in context when responding to potentially unsafe prompts. This leads to state-of-the-art performance on certain benchmarks for risks such as generating illicit advice, choosing stereotyped responses, and succumbing to known jailbreaks. Training models to incorporate a chain of thought before answering has the potential to unlock substantial benefits, while also increasing potential risks that stem from heightened intelligence. The results underscore the need for building robust alignment methods, extensively stress-testing their efficacy, and maintaining meticulous risk management protocols. This report outlines the safety work carried out for the OpenAI o1 and OpenAI o1-mini models, including safety evaluations, external red teaming, and Preparedness Framework evaluations. Other features not listed in the report include: research scientists on the livestream said an internal evaluation indicated it made major mistakes about 34% less often than the o1 preview mode; the model seems geared toward scientists, engineers, and coders, is designed to solve thorny problems; read and understand multi-media inputs such a photo of a hand-drawn system for a data center in space, and answer tough questions to a layperson. <br> <br>

3. ***Meta’s Llama 3.3 Launch <br>
Meta released Llama 3.3, a compact yet powerful open-source model with 70B parameters, rivaling larger models in performance at a fraction of the cost. Licensed under a community agreement, it ensures responsible use and attribution. Outperforming prior models in NLP benchmarks like multilingual dialogue and reasoning, Llama 3.3 offers accessible high-quality AI with reduced computational requirements.*** <br> <br>
   Dec 6, according to [venturebeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/meta-launches-open-source-llama-3-3-shrinking-powerful-bigger-model-into-smaller-size/), Meta launches open source Llama 3.3, shrinking powerful bigger model into smaller size. With 70 billion parameters — or settings governing the model’s behavior — Llama 3.3 delivers results on par with Meta’s 405B parameter model from the Llama 3.1 from the summer, but at a fraction of the cost and computational overhead — e.g., the GPU capacity needed to run the model in an inference. It’s designed to offer top-tier performance and accessibility yet in a smaller package than prior foundation models. Meta’s Llama 3.3 is offered under the Llama 3.3 Community License Agreement, which grants a non-exclusive, royalty-free license for use, reproduction, distribution, and modification of the model and its outputs. Developers integrating Llama 3.3 into products or services must include appropriate attribution, such as “Built with Llama,” and adhere to an Acceptable Use Policy that prohibits activities like generating harmful content, violating laws, or enabling cyberattacks. According to Meta AI on X, the Llama 3.3 model handedly outperforms the identically sized Llama 3.1-70B as well as Amazon’s new Nova Pro model in several benchmarks such as multilingual dialogue, reasoning, and other advanced natural language processing (NLP) tasks (Nova outperforms it in HumanEval coding tasks). <br> <br>

5. ***Nvidia's NVILA for Efficient Visual Language Models (VLMs) <br>
Nvidia unveiled NVILA, an open VLM series focusing on efficiency and accuracy. By scaling and compressing visual data, NVILA processes high-res images and long videos efficiently, reducing training costs and latency. It matches or outperforms existing VLMs while significantly lowering resource consumption, facilitating advancements in image and video analysis.*** <br> <br>
   Dec 5, Nvidia published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04468) “NVILA: Efficient Frontier Visual Language Models”. Visual language models (VLMs) have made significant advances in accuracy in recent years. However, their efficiency has received much less attention. This paper introduces NVILA, a family of open VLMs designed to optimize both efficiency and accuracy. Building on top of VILA, the study improves its model architecture by first scaling up the spatial and temporal resolutions, and then compressing visual tokens. This "scale-then-compress" approach enables NVILA to efficiently process high-resolution images and long videos. The authors also conduct a systematic investigation to enhance the efficiency of NVILA throughout its entire lifecycle, from training and fine-tuning to deployment. NVILA matches or surpasses the accuracy of many leading open and proprietary VLMs across a wide range of image and video benchmarks. At the same time, it reduces training costs by 4.5X, fine-tuning memory usage by 3.4X, pre-filling latency by 1.6-2.2X, and decoding latency by 1.2-2.8X. [Code](https://github.com/NVlabs/VILA) and models are available to facilitate reproducibility. <br> <br>

7. ***Task Scaling Laws from Model Ladders <br>
A new study introduces task scaling laws using compute-efficient model ladders to predict language model task performance. By training smaller "ladder" models, researchers forecast larger model accuracy with minimal computational cost. While predictions are accurate on low-variance tasks, challenges remain for high-variance tasks. The approach underscores the value of efficient, predictive methods in AI scaling.*** <br> <br>
   Dec 5, Aillen Inst of AI, Uni of Washington and Princeton Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04403) “Establishing Task Scaling Laws via Compute-Efficient Model Ladders”. The study develops task scaling laws and model ladders to predict the individual task performance of pretrained language models (LMs) in the overtrained setting. Standard power laws for language modeling loss cannot accurately model task performance. Therefore, the work leverages a two-step prediction approach: first use model and data size to predict a task-specific loss, and then use this task loss to predict task performance. The study trains a set of small-scale "ladder" models, collect data points to fit the parameterized functions of the two prediction steps, and make predictions for two target models: a 7B model trained to 4T tokens and a 13B model trained to 5T tokens. Training the ladder models only costs 1% of the compute used for the target models. On four multiple-choice tasks written in ranked classification format, the study can predict the accuracy of both target models within 2 points of absolute error. The authors have higher prediction error on four other tasks (average absolute error 6.9) and find that these are often tasks with higher variance in task metrics. The study also finds that using less compute to train fewer ladder models tends to deteriorate predictions. Finally, the research empirically shows that the design choices and the two-step approach lead to superior performance in establishing scaling laws.  <br> <br>

9. ***Challenges in Human Evaluations of Chatbots <br>
A Cornell study highlights flaws in open human evaluation platforms like Chatbot Arena. Bad annotations, either from apathetic or adversarial users, can significantly distort model rankings. Ensuring reliable annotations requires robust guardrails, as even minor issues can misrepresent model capabilities and hinder trustworthiness.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 5, Cornell Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04363) “Challenges in Trustworthy Human Evaluation of Chatbots”. Open community-driven platforms like Chatbot Arena that collect user preference data from site visitors have gained a reputation as one of the most trustworthy publicly available benchmarks for LLM performance. While now standard, it is tricky to implement effective guardrails to collect high-quality annotations from humans. This work demonstrates that three sources of bad annotations, both malicious and otherwise, can corrupt the reliability of open leaderboard rankings. In particular, the work shows that only 10% of poor quality votes by apathetic (site visitors not appropriately incentivized to give correct votes) or adversarial (bad actors seeking to inflate the ranking of a target model) annotators can change the rankings of models by up to 5 places on the leaderboard. Finally, the paper discuss open challenges in ensuring high-quality human annotations. <br> <br>

11. ***Google’s GenCast for Probabilistic Weather Forecasting <br>
Google's GenCast introduces a breakthrough in ML-based probabilistic weather forecasting, outperforming traditional models like ENS in skill and speed. Leveraging decades of data, it produces global forecasts for 80+ variables within minutes, excelling in predicting extreme weather and renewable energy planning. This represents a leap forward in operational weather prediction.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 4, Nature published a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08252-9) from Google “Probabilistic weather forecasting with machine learning”. Weather forecasts are fundamentally uncertain, so predicting the range of probable weather scenarios is crucial for important decisions, from warning the public about hazardous weather to planning renewable energy use. Traditionally, weather forecasts have been based on numerical weather prediction (NWP), which relies on physics-based simulations of the atmosphere. Recent advances in machine learning (ML)-based weather prediction (MLWP) have produced ML-based models with less forecast error than single NWP simulations. However, these advances have focused primarily on single, deterministic forecasts that fail to represent uncertainty and estimate risk. Overall, MLWP has remained less accurate and reliable than state-of-the-art NWP ensemble forecasts. Here the study introduces GenCast, a probabilistic weather model with greater skill and speed than the top operational medium-range weather forecast in the world, ENS, the ensemble forecast of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. GenCast is an ML weather prediction method, trained on decades of reanalysis data. GenCast generates an ensemble of stochastic 15-day global forecasts, at 12-h steps and 0.25° latitude–longitude resolution, for more than 80 surface and atmospheric variables, in 8 min. It has greater skill than ENS on 97.2% of 1,320 targets evaluated and better predicts extreme weather, tropical cyclone tracks and wind power production. This work helps open the next chapter in operational weather forecasting, in which crucial weather-dependent decisions are made more accurately and efficiently. <br> <br>

13. ***PaliGemma 2 Vision-Language Model Upgrade <br>
Google enhanced the PaliGemma model with PaliGemma 2, combining versatile vision encoders and scalable language models across resolutions. Designed for diverse tasks, including OCR and radiography reports, PaliGemma 2 achieves state-of-the-art results in transfer learning, showcasing the interplay between task types, model size, and resolution in performance optimization.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 4, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03555) “PaliGemma 2: A Family of Versatile VLMs for Transfer”. PaliGemma 2 is an upgrade of the PaliGemma open Vision-Language Model (VLM) based on the Gemma 2 family of language models. The work combines the SigLIP-So400m vision encoder that was also used by PaliGemma with the whole range of Gemma 2 models, from the 2B one all the way up to the 27B model. The study trains these models at three resolutions (224px2 , 448px2 and 896px2) in multiple stages to equip them with broad knowledge for transfer via fine-tuning. The resulting family of base models covering different model sizes and resolutions allows to investigate factors impacting transfer performance (such as learning rate) and to analyze the interplay between the type of task, model size, and resolution. The work further increases the number and breadth of transfer tasks beyond the scope of PaliGemma including different OCR-related tasks such as table structure recognition, molecular structure recognition, music score recognition, as well as long fine-grained captioning and radiography report generation, on which PaliGemma 2 obtains state-of-the-art results. <br> <br>

15. ***Evaluating LMs as Synthetic Data Generators <br>
A study proposes AgoraBench to evaluate LMs’ synthetic data generation, finding distinct strengths like problem generation (GPT-4o) and enhancement (Claude-3.5). Key insights show data quality, not problem-solving ability, dictates generation effectiveness. Strategic formats and cost-efficient models optimize synthetic data for downstream AI applications.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 4, CMU, Uni of Washington, NEC et al. published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03679) “Evaluating Language Models as Synthetic Data Generators”. Given the increasing use of synthetic data in language model (LM) post-training, an LM's ability to generate high-quality data has become nearly as crucial as its ability to solve problems directly. While prior works have focused on developing effective data generation methods, they lack systematic comparison of different LMs as data generators in a unified setting. To address this gap, the study proposes AgoraBench, a benchmark that provides standardized settings and metrics to evaluate LMs' data generation abilities. Through synthesizing 1.26 million training instances using 6 LMs and training 99 student models, the study uncovers key insights about LMs' data generation capabilities. First, LMs exhibit distinct strengths. For instance, GPT-4o excels at generating new problems, while Claude-3.5-Sonnet performs better at enhancing existing ones. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that an LM's data generation ability doesn't necessarily correlate with its problem-solving ability. Instead, multiple intrinsic features of data quality-including response quality, perplexity, and instruction difficulty-collectively serve as better indicators. Finally, the work demonstrates that strategic choices in output format and cost-conscious model selection significantly impact data generation effectiveness. <br> <br>

17. ***Best-of-N Jailbreaking Algorithm <br>
Researchers introduce Best-of-N (BoN) Jailbreaking, which exploits prompt variations to bypass AI safeguards across modalities. Achieving high attack success rates, BoN demonstrates vulnerabilities in both proprietary and open-source defenses. The method’s scalability highlights the persistent challenge of ensuring AI robustness against adversarial exploitation.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 4, Speechmatics, MATS, UCL, Stanford Uni, Uni of Oxford, Tangentic and Anthropic published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03556) “Best-of-N Jailbreaking”. The study introduces Best-of-N (BoN) Jailbreaking, a simple black-box algorithm that jailbreaks frontier AI systems across modalities. BoN Jailbreaking works by repeatedly sampling variations of a prompt with a combination of augmentations - such as random shuffling or capitalization for textual prompts - until a harmful response is elicited. The work finds that BoN Jailbreaking achieves high attack success rates (ASRs) on closed-source language models, such as 89% on GPT-4o and 78% on Claude 3.5 Sonnet when sampling 10,000 augmented prompts. Further, it is similarly effective at circumventing state-of-the-art open-source defenses like circuit breakers. BoN also seamlessly extends to other modalities: it jailbreaks vision language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o and audio language models (ALMs) like Gemini 1.5 Pro, using modality-specific augmentations. BoN reliably improves when sampled more augmented prompts. Across all modalities, ASR, as a function of the number of samples (N), empirically follows power-law-like behavior for many orders of magnitude. BoN Jailbreaking can also be composed with other black-box algorithms for even more effective attacks - combining BoN with an optimized prefix attack achieves up to a 35% increase in ASR. Overall, the work indicates that, despite their capability, language models are sensitive to seemingly innocuous changes to inputs, which attackers can exploit across modalities. <br> <br>

19. ***The Path to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) <br>
An article discusses the limitations of LLMs in achieving AGI, citing challenges like data dependency, poor generalization, and lack of feedback mechanisms. Progressing toward AGI requires innovative architectures and careful ethical considerations to manage risks and prioritize societal well-being.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 3, Nature published an [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03905-1) “How close is AI to human-level intelligence”. The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's o1 have reignited the debate about artificial general intelligence (AGI), an AI system capable of human-level cognition. While LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities in various tasks, they are not sufficient to achieve AGI on their own. The limitations of LLMs include their reliance on vast amounts of data, their inability to generalize effectively, and their lack of internal feedback mechanisms. To progress towards AGI, researchers are exploring new architectures and training techniques, such as generative flow networks and world model construction. However, the development of AGI raises significant ethical concerns. It is crucial to ensure that AI systems are developed responsibly and that their potential risks are mitigated. Researchers and policymakers must work together to establish guidelines and regulations for AI development, prioritizing safety and societal well-being. <br> <br>

21. ***Small Language Models (SLMs) for Businesses <br>
Forbes advocates for SLMs over LLMs for business use, emphasizing their efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and domain-specific advantages. SLMs secure data, reduce resource consumption, and offer tailored solutions, highlighting the importance of selecting the right AI for optimizing business operations and fostering trust in AI systems.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 3, Forbes published an [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/deandebiase/2024/11/25/why-small-language-models-are-the-next-big-thing-in-ai/) “Why Small Language Models Are The Next Big Thing In AI”. The article argues that while large language models (LLMs) from tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are powerful, they may not be the best fit for every business due to their high costs and resource demands. Instead, small language models (SLMs) and domain-specific LLMs offer more tailored, efficient, and cost-effective solutions. SLMs are trained on specific data types, keeping data secure within a company's firewall and reducing energy consumption. Domain-specific LLMs focus on specialized knowledge, providing more accurate and contextually relevant responses. These models require less computing power, can run on-premises, and offer greater control over data. The article highlights the importance of choosing the right AI model for specific business needs to optimize efficiency and reduce costs, emphasizing that trusted AI and data are crucial for future business solutions. <br> <br>

23. ***Multi-Agent LLM Training (MALT) <br>
A study introduces MALT, a collaborative AI training approach where multiple specialized LLMs jointly solve reasoning tasks. Employing sequential roles like generator and verifier, MALT improves accuracy in math and reasoning benchmarks, paving the way for multi-agent AI systems with cooperative problem-solving capabilities.*** <br> <br>
    Dec 2, Uni of Oxford, Cooperative AI Foundation, MBZUI and UC Berkeley published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01928) “MALT: Improving Reasoning with Multi-Agent LLM Training”. Enabling effective collaboration among LLMs is a crucial step toward developing autonomous systems capable of solving complex problems. While LLMs are typically used as single-model generators, where humans critique and refine their outputs, the potential for jointly-trained collaborative models remains largely unexplored. Despite promising results in multi-agent communication and debate settings, little progress has been made in training models to work together on tasks. This study presents a first step toward "Multi-agent LLM training" (MALT) on reasoning problems. The proposed approach employs a sequential multi-agent setup with heterogeneous LLMs assigned specialized roles: a generator, verifier, and refinement model iteratively solving problems. The study proposes a trajectory-expansion-based synthetic data generation process and a credit assignment strategy driven by joint outcome based rewards. This enables the post-training setup to utilize both positive and negative trajectories to autonomously improve each model's specialized capabilities as part of a joint sequential system. The study evaluates the approach across MATH, GSM8k, and CQA, where MALT on Llama 3.1 8B models achieves relative improvements of 14.14%, 7.12%, and 9.40% respectively over the same baseline model. This demonstrates an early advance in multi-agent cooperative capabilities for performance on mathematical and common sense reasoning questions. More generally, the work provides a concrete direction for research around multi-agent LLM training approaches. <br> <br>

25. ***Reverse-Enhanced Thinking in LLMs <br>
Reverse thinking, modeled after human reasoning, is introduced in LLMs via RevThink, a training framework combining forward and backward reasoning. The approach improves accuracy, sample efficiency, and generalization across reasoning tasks, offering a novel paradigm for enhancing AI reasoning.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 29, UNC and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.19865) “Reverse Thinking Makes LLMs Stronger Reasoners”. Reverse thinking plays a crucial role in human reasoning. Humans can reason not only from a problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start from the solution and reason towards the problem. This often enhances overall reasoning performance as it enables consistency checks between their forward and backward thinking. To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking, the study introduces Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (RevThink), a framework composed of data augmentation and learning objectives. In RevThink, the work augments the dataset by collecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher model, consisting of: (1) the original question, (2) forward reasoning, (3) backward question, and (4) backward reasoning. The study then employs three objectives to train a smaller student model in a multi-task learning fashion: (a) generate forward reasoning from a question, (b) generate a backward question from a question, and (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments across 12 datasets covering commonsense, math, and logical reasoning show an average 13.53% improvement over the student model's zero-shot performance and a 6.84% improvement over the strongest knowledge distillation baselines. Moreover, the method demonstrates sample efficiency -- using only 10% of the correct forward reasoning from the training data, it outperforms a standard fine-tuning method trained on 10x more forward reasoning. RevThink also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution held-out datasets. <br> <br>

27. ***Decoupled Momentum Optimization (DeMo) <br>
DeMo, a novel optimizer, reduces the need for high-speed interconnects in distributed training by decoupling momentum updates. Supporting scalable, bandwidth-efficient training, DeMo matches state-of-the-art performance while lowering resource demands, enabling cost-effective neural network pretraining.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 29, Nous Research published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.19870) “DeMo: Decoupled Momentum Optimization”. Training large neural networks typically requires sharing gradients between accelerators through specialized high-speed interconnects. Drawing from the signal processing principles of frequency decomposition and energy compaction, the study demonstrates that synchronizing full optimizer states and model parameters during training is unnecessary. By decoupling momentum updates and allowing controlled divergence in optimizer states across accelerators, the study achieves improved convergence compared to state-of-the-art optimizers. The work introduces {De}coupled {Mo}mentum (DeMo), a fused optimizer and data parallel algorithm that reduces inter-accelerator communication requirements by several orders of magnitude. This enables training of large neural networks even with limited network bandwidth and heterogeneous hardware. The method is topology-agnostic and architecture-independent and supports scalable clock-synchronous distributed training with negligible compute and memory overhead. Empirical results show that models trained with DeMo match or exceed the performance of equivalent models trained with AdamW, while eliminating the need for high-speed interconnects when pre-training large scale foundation models. An open source reference PyTorch implementation is published on GitHub at https://github.com/bloc97/DeMo <br> <br>

29. ***AI2T: Building Trustable AI Tutors <br>
Carnegie Mellon University introduced AI2T, a system enabling efficient creation of intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) via interactive teaching. AI2T learns through step-by-step solutions and self-assesses using STAND, a novel algorithm outperforming methods like XGBoost. The system can reliably induce rules for problem-solving with just 20–30 minutes of training, reducing the labor-intensive process of ITS programming. AI2T’s self-aware capabilities ensure more accurate and trustworthy outcomes compared to large language models, with promising implications for data-efficient, scalable ITS development.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 26, CMU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17924) “AI2T: Building Trustable AI Tutors by Interactively Teaching a Self-Aware Learning Agent”. AI2T is an interactively teachable AI for authoring intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). Authors tutor AI2T by providing a few step-by-step solutions and then grading AI2T's own problem-solving attempts. From just 20-30 minutes of interactive training, AI2T can induce robust rules for step-by-step solution tracking (i.e., model-tracing). As AI2T learns it can accurately estimate its certainty of performing correctly on unseen problem steps using STAND: a self-aware precondition learning algorithm that outperforms state-of-the-art methods like XGBoost. The user study shows that authors can use STAND's certainty heuristic to estimate when AI2T has been trained on enough diverse problems to induce correct and complete model-tracing programs. AI2T-induced programs are more reliable than hallucination-prone LLMs and prior authoring-by-tutoring approaches. With its self-aware induction of hierarchical rules, AI2T offers a path toward trustable data-efficient authoring-by-tutoring for complex ITSs that normally require as many as 200-300 hours of programming per hour of instruction. <br> <br>

31. ***AI in Scientific Discovery and Innovation <br>
MIT analyzed AI's impact on scientific and product innovation through a study involving the deployment of materials discovery AI in a corporate R&D setting. The findings revealed significant productivity boosts for high-performing scientists, with a 44% increase in discoveries, 39% more patent filings, and 17% greater product innovation. AI automated routine tasks, enabling researchers to focus on evaluating results. However, this benefit was unevenly distributed, primarily aiding top researchers. Despite the productivity gains, 82% of participants reported diminished job satisfaction due to reduced creativity and underutilization of skills, highlighting the trade-offs of AI augmentation.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 6, MIT published a [paper](https://aidantr.github.io/files/AI_innovation.pdf) “Artificial Intelligence, Scientific Discovery, and Product Innovation”. This paper studies the impact of artificial intelligence on innovation, exploiting the randomized introduction of a new materials discovery technology to 1,018 scientists in the R&D lab of a large U.S. firm. AI-assisted researchers discover 44% more materials, resulting in a 39% increase in patent filings and a 17% rise in downstream product innovation. These compounds possess more novel chemical structures and lead to more radical inventions. However, the technology has strikingly disparate effects across the productivity distribution: while the bottom third of scientists see little benefit, the output of top researchers nearly doubles. Investigating the mechanisms behind these results, the study shows that AI automates 57% of “idea-generation” tasks, reallocating researchers to the new task of evaluating model-produced candidate materials. Top scientists leverage their domain knowledge to prioritize promising AI suggestions, while others waste significant resources testing false positives. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of AI-augmented research and highlight the complementarity between algorithms and expertise in the innovative process. Survey evidence reveals that these gains come at a cost, however, as 82% of scientists report reduced satisfaction with their work due to decreased creativity and skill underutilization.

3. ***NeuroAI for AI Safety <br>
A paper explores neuroscience's role in AI safety, emphasizing the brain's architecture as a model for robust, cooperative, and pragmatic intelligence. The research outlines paths for AI safety inspired by neuroscience, including brain emulation, robust sensory systems, and interpretability via neuroscience methods. Recommendations include scaling cognitively inspired architectures and leveraging brain data for safer AI development.*** <br> <br>
   Nov 27, Amaranth Foundation, Princeton Uni, MIT, Stanford Uni et al. published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18526) “NeuroAI for AI Safety”. As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, the researchers highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. The work makes several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety. <br> <br>

5. ***LLMs Surpass Human Experts in Neuroscience Predictions <br>
A study highlights the potential of LLMs, particularly BrainGPT, to predict neuroscience results better than human experts by synthesizing decades of research. Using BrainBench, a benchmark for neuroscience prediction, LLMs demonstrated superior accuracy, especially when confident in their predictions. This approach is transferable to other knowledge-intensive fields, suggesting LLMs as valuable discovery tools.*** <br> <br>
   Nov 27, Nature Human Behaviour published a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-02046-9) “Large language models surpass human experts in predicting neuroscience results”. Scientific discoveries often hinge on synthesizing decades of research, a task that potentially outstrips human information processing capacities. Large language models (LLMs) offer a solution. LLMs trained on the vast scientific literature could potentially integrate noisy yet interrelated findings to forecast novel results better than human experts. Here, to evaluate this possibility, the study created BrainBench, a forward-looking benchmark for predicting neuroscience results. The study finds that LLMs surpass experts in predicting experimental outcomes. BrainGPT, an LLM tuned on the neuroscience literature, performed better yet. Like human experts, when LLMs indicated high confidence in their predictions, their responses were more likely to be correct, which presages a future where LLMs assist humans in making discoveries. The approach is not neuroscience specific and is transferable to other knowledge-intensive endeavours. <br> <br>

7. ***Nvidia's Star Attention for Efficient LLM Inference <br>
Nvidia introduced Star Attention, an efficient mechanism for long-sequence LLM inference that reduces computational costs and memory requirements. It uses block-sparse approximations and sequence-global attention, improving inference time by up to 11x while retaining 95-100% accuracy. The innovation integrates seamlessly with most Transformer-based LLMs and is available as open-source code.*** <br> <br>
   Nov 26, Nvidia published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17116) “Star Attention: Efficient LLM Inference over Long Sequences”. Inference with Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) on long sequences is both costly and slow due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. The study introduces Star Attention, a two-phase block-sparse approximation that improves computational efficiency by sharding attention across multiple hosts while minimizing communication overhead. In the first phase, the context is processed using blockwise-local attention across hosts, in parallel. In the second phase, query and response tokens attend to all prior cached tokens through sequence-global attention. Star Attention integrates seamlessly with most Transformer-based LLMs trained with global attention, reducing memory requirements and inference time by up to 11x while preserving 95-100% of accuracy. Code is here. <br> <br>
   
9. ***Critic-RM: Self-Generated Critiques in Reward Modeling <br>
Meta and Georgia Tech proposed Critic-RM, a framework that enhances reward modeling for LLMs by integrating self-generated critiques alongside scalar rewards. This two-stage process improves modeling accuracy and rectifies flawed reasoning steps, with experiments showing a 3.7%-7.3% accuracy improvement compared to standard models.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 26, Meta and Georgia Inst of Tech published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16646) “Self-Generated Critiques Boost Reward Modeling for Language Models”. Reward modeling is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, especially in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, current reward models mainly produce scalar scores and struggle to incorporate critiques in a natural language format. The study hypothesizes that predicting both critiques and the scalar reward would improve reward modeling ability. Motivated by this, the study proposes Critic-RM, a framework that improves reward models using self-generated critiques without extra supervision. Critic-RM employs a two-stage process: generating and filtering high-quality critiques, followed by joint fine-tuning on reward prediction and critique generation. Experiments across benchmarks show that Critic-RM improves reward modeling accuracy by 3.7%-7.3% compared to standard reward models and LLM judges, demonstrating strong performance and data efficiency. Additional studies further validate the effectiveness of generated critiques in rectifying flawed reasoning steps with 2.5%-3.2% gains in improving reasoning accuracy. <br> <br>
   
11. ***Limits of LLM Resampling with Imperfect Verifiers <br>
Princeton researchers showed that inference scaling using resampling has limitations when verifiers, like unit tests, are imperfect. False positives in coding tasks impose accuracy limits, and resampling cannot surpass the verifier's flaws. The study finds optimal sampling rates and highlights the need for strong models to reduce false positives and coding inaccuracies.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 26, Princeton Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17501) “Inference Scaling FLaws: The Limits of LLM Resampling with Imperfect Verifiers”. Recent research has generated hope that inference scaling could allow weaker language models to match or exceed the accuracy of stronger models, such as by repeatedly sampling solutions to a coding problem until it passes unit tests. The central thesis of this paper is that there is no free lunch for inference scaling: indefinite accuracy improvement through resampling can only be realized if the "verifier" (in this case, a set of unit tests) is perfect. When the verifier is imperfect, as it almost always is in domains such as reasoning or coding (for example, unit tests have imperfect coverage), there is a nonzero probability of false positives: incorrect solutions that pass the verifier. Resampling cannot decrease this probability, so it imposes an upper bound to the accuracy of resampling-based inference scaling even with an infinite compute budget. The study finds that there is a very strong correlation between the model's single-sample accuracy (i.e. accuracy without unit tests) and its false positive rate on coding benchmarks HumanEval and MBPP, whose unit tests have limited coverage. Therefore, no amount of inference scaling of weaker models can enable them to match the single-sample accuracy of a sufficiently strong model. When considering that false positives have a negative utility compared to abstaining from producing a solution, it bends the inference scaling curve further downward. Empirically, the study finds that the optimal number of samples can be less than 10 under realistic assumptions. Finally, the work shows that beyond accuracy, false positives may have other undesirable qualities, such as poor adherence to coding style conventions. <br> <br>
   
13. ***Extractive-Abstractive Spectrum in Information Sharing <br>
Stanford research introduced the extractive-abstractive spectrum to assess trade-offs in verifiability and utility in LLM outputs versus search engines. As outputs become more abstractive, utility improves, but verifiability decreases. The findings suggest domain-specific balancing of utility and verifiability for high-stakes LLM applications.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 26, Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17375) “The Extractive-Abstractive Spectrum: Uncovering Verifiability Trade-offs in LLM Generations”. Across all fields of academic study, experts cite their sources when sharing information. While large language models (LLMs) excel at synthesizing information, they do not provide reliable citation to sources, making it difficult to trace and verify the origins of the information they present. In contrast, search engines make sources readily accessible to users and place the burden of synthesizing information on the user. Through a survey, the study finds that users prefer search engines over LLMs for high-stakes queries, where concerns regarding information provenance outweigh the perceived utility of LLM responses. To examine the interplay between verifiability and utility of information-sharing tools, the study introduces the extractive-abstractive spectrum, in which search engines and LLMs are extreme endpoints encapsulating multiple unexplored intermediate operating points. Search engines are extractive because they respond to queries with snippets of sources with links (citations) to the original webpages. LLMs are abstractive because they address queries with answers that synthesize and logically transform relevant information from training and in-context sources without reliable citation. The study defines five operating points that span the extractive-abstractive spectrum and conduct human evaluations on seven systems across four diverse query distributions that reflect real-world QA settings: web search, language simplification, multi-step reasoning, and medical advice. As outputs become more abstractive, the study finds that perceived utility improves by as much as 200%, while the proportion of properly cited sentences decreases by as much as 50% and users take up to 3 times as long to verify cited information. The findings recommend distinct operating points for domain-specific LLM systems and the failure analysis informs approaches to high-utility LLM systems that empower users to verify information. <br> <br>

15. ***ShowUI: Advancing GUI Visual Agents <br>
The National University of Singapore and Microsoft presented ShowUI, a vision-language-action model for GUI tasks, achieving high efficiency and accuracy in zero-shot screenshot grounding. Innovations like UI-guided token selection and interleaved vision-language-action streaming enhance training and performance. ShowUI achieves 75.1% accuracy and is available as open-source software.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 26, National Uni of Singapore and Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17465) “ShowUI: One Vision-Language-Action Model for GUI Visual Agent”. Building Graphical User Interface (GUI) assistants holds significant promise for enhancing human workflow productivity. While most agents are language-based, relying on closed-source API with text-rich meta-information (e.g., HTML or accessibility tree), they show limitations in perceiving UI visuals as humans do, highlighting the need for GUI visual agents. This work develops a vision-language-action model in digital world, namely ShowUI, which features the following innovations: (i) UI-Guided Visual Token Selection to reduce computational costs by formulating screenshots as an UI connected graph, adaptively identifying their redundant relationship and serve as the criteria for token selection during self-attention blocks; (ii) Interleaved Vision-Language-Action Streaming that flexibly unifies diverse needs within GUI tasks, enabling effective management of visual-action history in navigation or pairing multi-turn query-action sequences per screenshot to enhance training efficiency; (iii) Small-scale High-quality GUI Instruction-following Datasets by careful data curation and employing a resampling strategy to address significant data type imbalances. With above components, ShowUI, a lightweight 2B model using 256K data, achieves a strong 75.1% accuracy in zero-shot screenshot grounding. Its UI-guided token selection further reduces 33% of redundant visual tokens during training and speeds up the performance by 1.4x. Navigation experiments across web Mind2Web, mobile AITW, and online MiniWob environments further underscore the effectiveness and potential of the model in advancing GUI visual agents. The models are available at https://github.com/showlab/ShowUI. <br> <br>

17. ***OneDiffusion: Versatile Large-Scale Diffusion Model <br>
OneDiffusion supports bidirectional image synthesis and understanding, handling tasks like text-to-image generation, depth estimation, and multi-view generation. Its unified training framework eliminates the need for specialized architectures, enabling scalable, multi-task training. The model demonstrates competitive performance across tasks and is open-sourced.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 25, AI2, Uni of California, and Uni of Washington published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16318) “One Diffusion to Generate Them All”. The work introduces OneDiffusion, a versatile, large-scale diffusion model that seamlessly supports bidirectional image synthesis and understanding across diverse tasks. It enables conditional generation from inputs such as text, depth, pose, layout, and semantic maps, while also handling tasks like image deblurring, upscaling, and reverse processes such as depth estimation and segmentation. Additionally, OneDiffusion allows for multi-view generation, camera pose estimation, and instant personalization using sequential image inputs. The model takes a straightforward yet effective approach by treating all tasks as frame sequences with varying noise scales during training, allowing any frame to act as a conditioning image at inference time. The unified training framework removes the need for specialized architectures, supports scalable multi-task training, and adapts smoothly to any resolution, enhancing both generalization and scalability. Experimental results demonstrate competitive performance across tasks in both generation and prediction such as text-to-image, multiview generation, ID preservation, depth estimation and camera pose estimation despite relatively small training dataset. Code and checkpoint are freely available at https://github.com/lehduong/OneDiffusion <br> <br>

19. ***LLM-as-a-Judge Framework <br>
A comprehensive study on LLM-based judgment and assessment introduces a taxonomy for scoring, ranking, and selection tasks. The research compiles benchmarks and highlights challenges in using LLMs for nuanced judgment, offering insights for advancing this emerging paradigm in AI.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 25, Arizona State Uni, Uni of Illinois Chicago, Uni of Maryland, UC Berkeley et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16594) “From Generation to Judgment: Opportunities and Challenges of LLM-as-a-judge” . Assessment and evaluation have long been critical challenges in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). However, traditional methods, whether matching-based or embedding-based, often fall short of judging subtle attributes and delivering satisfactory results. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) inspire the "LLM-as-ajudge" paradigm, where LLMs are leveraged to perform scoring, ranking, or selection across various tasks and applications. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-based judgment and assessment, offering an in-depth overview to advance this emerging field. The paper begins by giving detailed definitions from both input and output perspectives. Then the paper introduces a comprehensive taxonomy to explore LLM-as-a-judge from three dimensions: what to judge, how to judge and where to judge. Finally, the authors compile benchmarks for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge and highlight key challenges and promising directions, aiming to provide valuable insights and inspire future research in this promising research area. <br> <br>

21. ***Predicting Emergent Capabilities via Finetuning <br>
UC Berkeley researchers proposed a method to predict emergent LLM capabilities by finetuning smaller models on specific tasks. This approach anticipates when capabilities will emerge in future models, validated on benchmarks like GSM8K and CommonsenseQA. Emergence laws derived from this method offer practical predictive insights.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 25, UC Berkeley published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16035) “Predicting Emergent Capabilities by Finetuning”. A fundamental open challenge in modern LLM scaling is the lack of understanding around emergent capabilities. In particular, language model pretraining loss is known to be highly predictable as a function of compute. However, downstream capabilities are far less predictable -- sometimes even exhibiting emergent jumps -- which makes it challenging to anticipate the capabilities of future models. This study first poses the task of emergence prediction: given access to current LLMs that have random few-shot accuracy on a task, can people predict whether future models (GPT-N+1) will have non-trivial accuracy on that task? The study then discovers a simple insight for this problem: finetuning LLMs on a given task can shift the point in scaling at which emergence occurs towards less capable models. To operationalize this insight, the authors can finetune LLMs with varying amounts of data and fit a parametric function that predicts when emergence will occur (i.e., "emergence laws"). The study validates this approach using four standard NLP benchmarks where large-scale open-source LLMs already demonstrate emergence (MMLU, GSM8K, CommonsenseQA, and CoLA). Using only small-scale LLMs, the study finds that, in some cases, the authors can accurately predict whether models trained with up to 4x more compute have emerged. Finally, the work presents a case study of two realistic uses for emergence prediction. <br> <br>

23. ***LLM Embeddings for Regression <br>
Stanford and Google explored the use of LLM embeddings for regression tasks, finding them superior to traditional feature engineering for high-dimensional data. The study explains this performance through Lipschitz continuity and identifies that model size and language understanding do not consistently improve regression outcomes.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 22, Stanford Uni and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14708) “Understanding LLM Embeddings for Regression”. With the rise of large language models (LLMs) for flexibly processing information as strings, a natural application is regression, specifically by preprocessing string representations into LLM embeddings as downstream features for metric prediction. The study provides one of the first comprehensive investigations into embedding-based regression and demonstrate that LLM embeddings as features can be better for high-dimensional regression tasks than using traditional feature engineering. This regression performance can be explained in part due to LLM embeddings over numeric data inherently preserving Lipschitz continuity over the feature space. Furthermore, the study quantifies the contribution of different model effects, most notably model size and language understanding, which was found surprisingly do not always improve regression performance. <br> <br>

25. ***TÜLU 3: Open Post-Training for LLMs <br>
TÜLU 3 introduces open methods for post-training LLMs, surpassing models like Llama 3.1 and GPT-4o-mini in performance. Techniques include supervised fine-tuning, Direct Preference Optimization, and a novel RLVR method. The release includes comprehensive training recipes, datasets, and evaluations for reproducibility and adaptation.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 22, Allen Inst and Uni of Washington published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15124) “TÜLU 3: Pushing Frontiers in Open Language Model Post-Training”. Language model post-training is applied to refine behaviors and unlock new skills across a wide range of recent language models, but open recipes for applying these techniques lag behind proprietary ones. The underlying training data and recipes for post-training are simultaneously the most important pieces of the puzzle and the portion with the least transparency. To bridge this gap, the study introduces TÜLU 3, a family of fully-open state-of-the-art post-trained models, alongside its data, code, and training recipes, serving as a comprehensive guide for modern post-training techniques. TÜLU 3, which builds on Llama 3.1 base models, achieves results surpassing the instruct versions of Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, Mistral, and even closed models such as GPT-4o-mini and Claude 3.5-Haiku. The training algorithms for the models include supervised finetuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and a novel method which is called Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). With TÜLU 3, the study builds a multi-task evaluation scheme for posttraining with development and unseen evaluations, standard benchmark implementations, and substantial decontamination of existing open datasets on said benchmarks. The work concludes with analysis and discussion of training methods that did not reliably improve performance. The TÜLU 3 release includes model weights, a demo, and the complete recipe — datasets for diverse core skills, a robust toolkit for data curation and evaluation, the training code and infrastructure, and, most importantly, a detailed report for reproducing and further adapting the TÜLU 3 approach to more domains. <br> <br>

27. ***Google Scholar's Role in the AI Era <br>
As Google Scholar marks 20 years, it faces competition from AI-driven tools but remains a vital resource due to its extensive database and community integration. Despite criticisms of its algorithm transparency, innovations in AI-powered features aim to sustain its relevance amidst evolving scholarly search technologies.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 19, Nature published an [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03746-y) “Can Google Scholar survive the AI revolution?”. Google Scholar, the largest scholarly search engine, celebrates its 20th anniversary amid rising competition from AI-driven tools. Over the years, it has become a crucial resource for researchers due to its free access, extensive database, and sophisticated search capabilities. However, new AI-powered platforms like ChatGPT, Semantic Scholar, and OpenAlex are challenging its dominance by offering enhanced search experiences and data accessibility. Despite these advancements, Google Scholar's comprehensive coverage and deep integration in the scientific community make it difficult to displace. Co-founder Anurag Acharya emphasizes that Google Scholar's primary goal is to aid scholars in finding valuable research, and it continues to innovate with AI features like article ranking and search suggestions. Yet, it faces criticism for its lack of transparency regarding its search algorithms and content coverage. As AI tools evolve, the future of scholarly search engines remains dynamic, with Google Scholar striving to maintain its leading position while welcoming innovations that advance scientific research. <br> <br>

29. ***RPN 2: Unified Model for Complex Data <br>
RPN 2 introduces interdependence functions to enhance learning performance for complex, dependent data. By unifying backbones like CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers, the model offers a broader canonical representation and potential for innovative architecture designs surpassing existing methods.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 17, Uni of California, Davis published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11162) “RPN 2: On Interdependence Function Learning Towards Unifying and Advancing CNN, RNN, GNN, and Transformer”. This paper builds upon the previous work on the Reconciled Polynomial Network (RPN). The original RPN model was designed under the assumption of input data independence, presuming the independence among both individual instances within data batches and attributes in each data instance. However, this assumption often proves invalid for function learning tasks involving complex, interdependent data such as language, images, time series, and graphs. Ignoring such data interdependence may inevitably lead to significant performance degradation. To overcome these limitations, the study introduces the new Reconciled Polynomial Network (version 2), namely RPN 2. By incorporating data and structural interdependence functions, RPN 2 explicitly models data interdependence via new component functions in its architecture. This enhancement not only significantly improves RPN 2's learning performance but also substantially expands its unifying potential, enabling it to encompass a broader range of contemporary dominant backbone models within its canonical representation. These backbones include, but are not limited to, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and Transformers. The analysis reveals that the fundamental distinctions among these backbone models primarily stem from their diverse approaches to defining the interdependence functions. Furthermore, this unified representation opens up new opportunities for designing innovative architectures with the potential to surpass the performance of these dominant backbones. <br> <br>

31. ***Self-Taught Optimizer (STOP): Recursive Code Improvement <br>
Stanford, Microsoft, and OpenAI demonstrated that a scaffolding program infused with LLMs can recursively improve itself via strategies like beam search and genetic algorithms. Although not fully recursive self-improvement, this method significantly enhances code performance, highlighting potential advancements and risks in self-improving technologies.*** <br> <br>
    Aug 16, Stanford Uni, Microsoft and OpenAI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02304) “Self-Taught Optimizer (STOP): Recursively Self-Improving Code Generation”. Several recent advances in AI systems solve problems by providing a "scaffolding" program that structures multiple calls to language models (LMs) to generate better outputs. A scaffolding program is written in a programming language such as Python. This study uses a language-model-infused scaffolding program to improve itself. The work starts with a seed "improver" that improves an input program according to a given utility function by querying an LM several times and returning the best solution. The authors then run this seed improver to improve itself. Across a small set of downstream tasks, the resulting improved improver generates programs with significantly better performance than its seed improver. A variety of self-improvement strategies are proposed by the language model, including beam search, genetic algorithms, and simulated annealing. Since the language models themselves are not altered, this is not full recursive self-improvement. Nonetheless, it demonstrates that a modern language model, GPT-4 in the experiments, is capable of writing code that can call itself to improve itself. The authors consider concerns around the development of self-improving technologies and evaluate the frequency with which the generated code bypasses a sandbox.

By integrating image and text modalities, these encoders achieve outstanding performance in tasks like localization and classification. AIMV2 surpasses state-of-the-art models such as CLIP in multimodal evaluations, showcasing scalability and robust capabilities, including a record-breaking 89.5% ImageNet-1k accuracy.*** <br> <br>
   Nov 21, Apple published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14402) “Multimodal Autoregressive Pre-training of Large Vision Encoders”. The paper introduces a novel method for pre-training of large-scale vision encoders. Building on recent advancements in autoregressive pre-training of vision models, the study extends this framework to a multimodal setting, i.e., images and text. The study presents AIMV2, a family of generalist vision encoders characterized by a straightforward pre-training process, scalability, and remarkable performance across a range of downstream tasks. This is achieved by pairing the vision encoder with a multimodal decoder that autoregressively generates raw image patches and text tokens. The encoders excel not only in multimodal evaluations but also in vision benchmarks such as localization, grounding, and classification. Notably, the AIMV2-3B encoder achieves 89.5% accuracy on ImageNet-1k with a frozen trunk. Furthermore, AIMV2 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art contrastive models (e.g., CLIP, SigLIP) in multimodal image understanding across diverse settings.

5. ***Platform Engineering Evolution:  <br>Forbes highlights the rise of platform engineering as a more structured alternative to DevOps, which has become ambiguous over time. This approach separates operational and development tasks, allowing teams to focus on their strengths. Popularized at events like KubeCon, platform engineering leverages cloud-native technologies and offers a scalable framework for modern infrastructure and development needs.*** <br> <br>
   Nov 21, Forbes published an [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/justinwarren/2024/11/21/platform-engineering-is-the-new-devops/) “Platform Engineering Is The New DevOps”. The article discusses how platform engineering is emerging as a preferred term over DevOps in the cloud-native community. Initially, DevOps aimed to bridge the gap between developers and operations, promoting collaboration. However, over time, the term became ambiguous and overused, leading to confusion and inefficiency. DevOps often resulted in developers handling operations tasks they were not interested in, causing friction and dissatisfaction. Platform engineering offers a solution by clearly separating operations from application development, allowing each team to focus on their strengths. This shift is seen as a natural evolution in the cloud-native ecosystem, with platform engineering gaining popularity at events like KubeCon. Unlike DevOps, which lacked a formal definition and became a catch-all term, platform engineering is viewed as a more structured and scalable approach. It emphasizes using cloud-native technologies rather than building them, aligning with the operational needs of modern organizations. Companies are encouraged to reassess their DevOps structures to ensure they are still effective, as platform engineering may provide a more efficient and focused framework for managing infrastructure and development tasks. <br> <br>

7. ***OpenScholar for Literature Synthesis:  <br>Researchers introduce OpenScholar, a retrieval-augmented language model designed for synthesizing scientific literature. Leveraging a datastore of 45 million papers, it provides citation-backed responses to scientific queries. OpenScholar outperforms GPT-4o in correctness and citation accuracy and is well-received in expert evaluations, signaling significant advancements in research assistance.*** <br> <br>
   Nov 21, Uni of Washington, Allen Inst for AI, UIUC, CMU, Meta, UNCC, and Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14199) “OpenScholar: Synthesizing Scientific Literature with Retrieval-augmented LMs”. Scientific progress depends on researchers' ability to synthesize the growing body of literature. Can large language models (LMs) assist scientists in this task? The study introduce OpenScholar, a specialized retrieval-augmented LM that answers scientific queries by identifying relevant passages from 45 million open-access papers and synthesizing citation-backed responses. To evaluate OpenScholar, the authors develop ScholarQABench, the first large-scale multi-domain benchmark for literature search, comprising 2,967 expert-written queries and 208 long-form answers across computer science, physics, neuroscience, and biomedicine. On ScholarQABench, OpenScholar-8B outperforms GPT-4o by 5% and PaperQA2 by 7% in correctness, despite being a smaller, open model. While GPT4o hallucinates citations 78 to 90% of the time, OpenScholar achieves citation accuracy on par with human experts. OpenScholar's datastore, retriever, and self-feedback inference loop also improves off-the-shelf LMs: for instance, OpenScholar-GPT4o improves GPT-4o's correctness by 12%. In human evaluations, experts preferred OpenScholar-8B and OpenScholar-GPT4o responses over expert-written ones 51% and 70% of the time, respectively, compared to GPT4o's 32%. The authors open-source all of the [code](https://github.com/AkariAsai/OpenScholar), [models](https://huggingface.co/collections/OpenScholar/openscholar-v1-67376a89f6a80f448da411a6), datastore, data and a public demo. <br> <br>

9. ***Knowledge Awareness in LLMs:  <br>A study explores how large language models recognize entities and avoid hallucinations using sparse autoencoders. By identifying causal directions in model representation spaces, researchers demonstrate that models can self-regulate their responses based on known or unknown entities. These findings provide insights into improving model reliability and interpretability.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 21, UPC and ETH Zurich published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14257) “Do I Know This Entity? Knowledge Awareness and Hallucinations in Language Models”. Hallucinations in large language models are a widespread problem, yet the mechanisms behind whether models will hallucinate are poorly understood, limiting the ability to solve this problem. Using sparse autoencoders as an interpretability tool, the study discovers that a key part of these mechanisms is entity recognition, where the model detects if an entity is one it can recall facts about. Sparse autoencoders uncover meaningful directions in the representation space, these detect whether the model recognizes an entity, e.g. detecting it doesn't know about an athlete or a movie. This suggests that models can have self-knowledge: internal representations about their own capabilities. These directions are causally relevant: capable of steering the model to refuse to answer questions about known entities, or to hallucinate attributes of unknown entities when it would otherwise refuse. The study demonstrates that despite the sparse autoencoders being trained on the base model, these directions have a causal effect on the chat model's refusal behavior, suggesting that chat finetuning has repurposed this existing mechanism. Furthermore, the work provides an initial exploration into the mechanistic role of these directions in the model, finding that they disrupt the attention of downstream heads that typically move entity attributes to the final token. <br> <br>

11. ***Quantum Error Decoding with AI:  <br>Google presents a transformer-based neural network decoder for quantum error correction. This decoder surpasses traditional approaches in accuracy and adapts to complex error distributions, even with limited experimental data. The work underscores the potential of machine learning to revolutionize quantum computing by learning from data rather than human-designed algorithms.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 20, Google published a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08148-8) on Nature “Learning high-accuracy error decoding for quantum processors”. Building a large-scale quantum computer requires effective strategies to correct errors that inevitably arise in physical quantum systems. Quantum error-correction codes present a way to reach this goal by encoding logical information redundantly into many physical qubits. A key challenge in implementing such codes is accurately decoding noisy syndrome information extracted from redundancy checks to obtain the correct encoded logical information. Here the researchers develop a recurrent, transformer-based neural network that learns to decode the surface code, the leading quantum error-correction code. The decoder outperforms other state-of-the-art decoders on real-world data from Google’s Sycamore quantum processor for distance-3 and distance-5 surface codes. On distances up to 11, the decoder maintains its advantage on simulated data with realistic noise including cross-talk and leakage, utilizing soft readouts and leakage information. After training on approximate synthetic data, the decoder adapts to the more complex, but unknown, underlying error distribution by training on a limited budget of experimental samples. The work illustrates the ability of machine learning to go beyond human-designed algorithms by learning from data directly, highlighting machine learning as a strong contender for decoding in quantum computers. <br> <br>

13. ***Hymba for Small Language Models:  <br>Nvidia's Hymba architecture combines attention mechanisms with state space models to enhance efficiency in small language models. It introduces innovations like learnable meta tokens and cross-layer sharing, achieving state-of-the-art performance among sub-2B models and offering significant improvements in cache size and throughput.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 20, Nvidia published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.13676) “Hymba: A Hybrid-head Architecture for Small Language Models”. The study proposes Hymba, a family of small language models featuring a hybrid-head parallel architecture that integrates transformer attention mechanisms with state space models (SSMs) for enhanced efficiency. Attention heads provide high-resolution recall, while SSM heads enable efficient context summarization. Additionally, the study introduces learnable meta tokens that are prepended to prompts, storing critical information and alleviating the "forced-to-attend" burden associated with attention mechanisms. This model is further optimized by incorporating cross-layer key-value (KV) sharing and partial sliding window attention, resulting in a compact cache size. During development, the study conducted a controlled study comparing various architectures under identical settings and observed significant advantages of the proposed architecture. Notably, Hymba achieves state-of-the-art results for small LMs: the Hymba-1.5B-Base model surpasses all sub-2B public models in performance and even outperforms Llama-3.2-3B with 1.32% higher average accuracy, an 11.67x cache size reduction, and 3.49x throughput. <br> <br>

15. ***RedPajama Open Datasets:  <br>The RedPajama project tackles challenges in transparency and quality of datasets for training large language models. By releasing RedPajama-V1 and V2, the study provides over 100 trillion tokens with metadata and quality signals, fostering the development of transparent and high-performing open-source language models.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 19, Together AI, Stanford Uni, Uni of Chicago, EleutherAI, Ontocord.ai, Princeton Uni, ETH Zurich, Mila, Uni of Montreal et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12372) “RedPajama: an Open Dataset for Training Large Language Models”. Large language models are increasingly becoming a cornerstone technology in artificial intelligence, the sciences, and society as a whole, yet the optimal strategies for dataset composition and filtering remain largely elusive. Many of the top-performing models lack transparency in their dataset curation and model development processes, posing an obstacle to the development of fully open language models. This work identifies three core data-related challenges that must be addressed to advance open-source language models. These include (1) transparency in model development, including the data curation process, (2) access to large quantities of high-quality data, and (3) availability of artifacts and metadata for dataset curation and analysis. To address these challenges, the work releases RedPajama-V1, an open reproduction of the LLaMA training dataset. In addition, we release RedPajama-V2, a massive web-only dataset consisting of raw, unfiltered text data together with quality signals and metadata. Together, the RedPajama datasets comprise over 100 trillion tokens spanning multiple domains and with their quality signals facilitate the filtering of data, aiming to inspire the development of numerous new datasets. To date, these datasets have already been used in the training of strong language models used in production, such as Snowflake Arctic, Salesforce's XGen and AI2's OLMo. To provide insight into the quality of RedPajama, the study presents a series of analyses and ablation studies with decoder-only language models with up to 1.6B parameters. The findings demonstrate how quality signals for web data can be effectively leveraged to curate high-quality subsets of the dataset, underscoring the potential of RedPajama to advance the development of transparent and high-performing language models at scale. <br> <br>

17. ***Scaling Laws Across Datasets:  <br>Harvard's study extends scaling laws to predict model loss across different datasets and tasks. By identifying shifted power law relationships, it demonstrates reliable loss predictions across diverse pre-training and downstream scenarios. These findings advance understanding of generalization in large-scale AI models.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 19, Harvard Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12925) “Loss-to-Loss Prediction: Scaling Laws for All Datasets”. While scaling laws provide a reliable methodology for predicting train loss across compute scales for a single data distribution, less is known about how these predictions should change as the distribution is changed. This study derives a strategy for predicting one loss from another and apply it to predict across different pre-training datasets and from pre-training data to downstream task data. The predictions extrapolate well even at 20x the largest FLOP budget used to fit the curves. More precisely, the work finds that there are simple shifted power law relationships between (1) the train losses of two models trained on two separate datasets when the models are paired by training compute (train-to-train), (2) the train loss and the test loss on any downstream distribution for a single model (train-to-test), and (3) the test losses of two models trained on two separate train datasets (test-to-test). The results hold up for pre-training datasets that differ substantially (some are entirely code and others have no code at all) and across a variety of downstream tasks. Finally, the study finds that in some settings these shifted power law relationships can yield more accurate predictions than extrapolating single-dataset scaling laws. <br> <br>

19. ***Generative World Explorer (Genex):  <br>Johns Hopkins introduces Genex, a framework enabling AI agents to mentally explore large 3D worlds and update beliefs with imagined observations. This approach improves decision-making and planning in partial-observation scenarios, showcasing the potential of generative methods for embodied AI.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 19, Johns Hopkins Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11844) “Generative World Explorer”. Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can imagine unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and revise their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, the study introduces the Generative World Explorer (Genex), an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train Genex, the study creates a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Experimental results demonstrate that (1) Genex can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans. <br> <br>

21. ***Procedural Knowledge in LLMs:  <br>UCL and collaborators reveal that LLM reasoning relies on procedural knowledge rather than retrieval-like strategies. Through pretraining data analysis, the study highlights how models synthesize procedural insights to solve reasoning tasks, differentiating them from fact-based question answering.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 19, UCL, Cohere et al. published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12580) “Procedural Knowledge in Pretraining Drives Reasoning in Large Language Models”. The capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models have been sketched out in great detail in recent years, providing an intriguing yet conflicting picture. On the one hand, LLMs demonstrate a general ability to solve problems. On the other hand, they show surprising reasoning gaps when compared to humans, casting doubt on the robustness of their generalisation strategies. The sheer volume of data used in the design of LLMs has precluded the authors from applying the method traditionally used to measure generalisation: train-test set separation. To overcome this, the authors study what kind of generalisation strategies LLMs employ when performing reasoning tasks by investigating the pretraining data they rely on. For two models of different sizes (7B and 35B) and 2.5B of their pretraining tokens, the study identifies what documents influence the model outputs for three simple mathematical reasoning tasks and contrast this to the data that are influential for answering factual questions. The study finds that, while the models rely on mostly distinct sets of data for each factual question, a document often has a similar influence across different reasoning questions within the same task, indicating the presence of procedural knowledge. The study further finds that the answers to factual questions often show up in the most influential data. However, for reasoning questions the answers usually do not show up as highly influential, nor do the answers to the intermediate reasoning steps. When characterising the top ranked documents for the reasoning questions qualitatively, the study confirms that the influential documents often contain procedural knowledge, like demonstrating how to obtain a solution using formulae or code. The findings indicate that the approach to reasoning the models use is unlike retrieval, and more like a generalisable strategy that synthesises procedural knowledge from documents doing a similar form of reasoning. <br> <br>

23. ***Pixtral Large Multimodal Model:  <br>Mistral unveils Pixtral Large, a state-of-the-art multimodal model excelling in image understanding and reasoning. It outperforms leading models in benchmarks like MathVista and DocVQA and introduces advancements in handling complex visual data, reaffirming its leadership in multimodal AI.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 18, Mistral [released Pixtral Large](https://mistral.ai/news/pixtral-large/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email), a 124B open-weights multimodal model built on top of Mistral Large 2. Pixtral Large is the second model in the multimodal family and demonstrates frontier-level image understanding. Particularly, the model is able to understand documents, charts and natural images, while maintaining the leading text-only understanding of Mistral Large 2. Mistral evaluates Pixtral Large against frontier models on a set of standard multimodal benchmarks, through a common testing harness. On MathVista, which evaluates complex mathematical reasoning over visual data, the model achieves 69.4%, outperforming all other models. To assess reasoning capabilities over complex charts and documents, Mistral evaluates performance using ChartQA and DocVQA, where Pixtral Large surpasses GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 Pro. Finally, Pixtral Large demonstrates competitive capabilities on MM-MT-Bench, outperforming all of Claude-3.5 Sonnet (new), Gemini-1.5 Pro and GPT-4o (latest). MM-MT-Bench is an open-source, judge-based evaluation intended to reflect real-world use cases of multimodal LLMs (see the Pixtral 12B [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07073) for details). Along with Pixtral Large, Mistral Large, the state-of-the-art text model, also gets an update. The model is available as pixtral-large-latest on our API, as well as for self-deployment as Mistral Large 24.11 on HuggingFace under the Mistral Research License (MRL) for research, or with a commercial license from Mistral AI for commercial use. <br> <br>

25. ***Challenges in Reranker Scaling:  <br>Databricks identifies limitations in reranker performance as the number of documents increases. Contrary to expectations, rerankers show diminishing returns and can degrade retrieval quality when overburdened, calling for research into scalable reranking methods.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 18, Databricks and UIUC published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11767) “Drowning in Documents: Consequences of Scaling Reranker Inference”. Rerankers, typically cross-encoders, are often used to re-score the documents retrieved by cheaper initial IR systems. This is because, though expensive, rerankers are assumed to be more effective. The study challenges this assumption by measuring reranker performance for full retrieval, not just re-scoring first-stage retrieval. Experiments reveal a surprising trend: the best existing rerankers provide diminishing returns when scoring progressively more documents and actually degrade quality beyond a certain limit. In fact, in this setting, rerankers can frequently assign high scores to documents with no lexical or semantic overlap with the query. The authors hope that the findings will spur future research to improve reranking. <br> <br>

27. ***LLMs’ Flexibility Beyond Linguistics:  <br>A study finds that LLMs perform equally well on forward and backward scientific text, suggesting their success stems from their architecture's ability to learn structured patterns rather than human-like linguistic processing. This highlights the generality of transformers across domains.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 17, Uni College London and Uni of Tubingen published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11061v1) “Beyond Human-Like Processing: Large Language Models Perform Equivalently on Forward and Backward Scientific Text”. The impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) has led to their consideration as models of human language processing. Instead, the work suggests that the success of LLMs arises from the flexibility of the transformer learning architecture. To evaluate this conjecture, the work trained LLMs on scientific texts that were either in a forward or backward format. Despite backward text being inconsistent with the structure of human languages, the study found that LLMs performed equally well in either format on a neuroscience benchmark, eclipsing human expert performance for both forward and backward orders. The results are consistent with the success of transformers across diverse domains, such as weather prediction and protein design. This widespread success is attributable to LLM’s ability to extract predictive patterns from any sufficiently structured input. Given their generality, we suggest caution in interpreting LLM’s success in linguistic tasks as evidence for human-like mechanisms. <br> <br>

29. ***AI for Chip Design:  <br>Google defends its deep reinforcement learning method, AlphaChip, against critiques questioning its chip design capabilities. The response underscores the method’s impact, which has already achieved widespread adoption, and addresses flaws in critical evaluations, reaffirming the method's validity.***
    Nov 15, Google and Stanford published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10053) “That Chip Has Sailed: A Critique of Unfounded Skepticism Around AI for Chip Design”. In 2020, Google introduced a deep reinforcement learning method capable of generating superhuman chip layouts, which Google then published in Nature and open-sourced on GitHub. AlphaChip has inspired an explosion of work on AI for chip design, and has been deployed in state-of-the-art chips across Alphabet and extended by external chipmakers. Even so, a non-peer-reviewed invited paper at ISPD 2023 questioned its performance claims, despite failing to run the method as described in Nature. For example, it did not pre-train the RL method (removing its ability to learn from prior experience), used substantially fewer compute resources (20x fewer RL experience collectors and half as many GPUs), did not train to convergence (standard practice in machine learning), and evaluated on test cases that are not representative of modern chips. Recently, Igor Markov published a meta-analysis of three papers: Google’s peer-reviewed Nature paper, the non-peer-reviewed ISPD paper, and Markov's own unpublished paper (though he does not disclose that he co-authored it). Although AlphaChip has already achieved widespread adoption and impact, the authors publish this response to ensure that no one is wrongly discouraged from innovating in this impactful area.

31. ***Microsoft and MIT explore prompt formatting's impact on LLM performance: <br>
Prompt optimization is crucial for LLM effectiveness, yet the role of prompt templates has been underexplored. This study evaluates how formatting the same contexts into templates like plain text, Markdown, JSON, and YAML affects LLM performance across tasks like reasoning, code generation, and translation. Results show significant variability: GPT-3.5-turbo’s performance fluctuated by up to 40% in code translation tasks depending on the prompt template, while GPT-4 proved more robust. The findings challenge the reliance on fixed prompt formats and call for more flexibility in their design.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 15, Microsoft, and MIT published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10541v1) “Does Prompt Formatting Have Any Impact on LLM Performance?”. In the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt optimization is crucial for model performance. Although previous research has explored aspects like rephrasing prompt contexts, using various prompting techniques (like in-context learning and chain-of-thought), and ordering few-shot examples, the understanding of LLM sensitivity to prompt templates remains limited. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of different prompt templates on LLM performance. The study formatted the same contexts into various human-readable templates, including plain text, Markdown, JSON, and YAML, and evaluated their impact across tasks like natural language reasoning, code generation, and translation using OpenAI’s GPT models. Experiments show that GPT-3.5-turbo’s performance varies by up to 40% in a code translation task depending on the prompt template, while larger models like GPT-4 are more robust to these variations. The analysis highlights the need to reconsider the use of fixed prompt templates, as different formats can significantly affect model performance. <br> <br>

33. ***University of Oxford investigates AI feedback guided by constitutions" <br>
AI models increasingly rely on "constitutions"—guidelines used for feedback and training. This study examined four constitutions designed to improve patient-centered communication in medical interviews. Evaluations by 215 human raters revealed that detailed constitutions enhanced emotive qualities but failed to outperform baselines in practical skills like information gathering. The research suggests that while detailed constitutions can improve certain aspects of AI feedback, their efficacy as a reward signal for practical applications may have limitations.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 15, Uni of Oxford published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10168) “Evaluating the role of ‘Constitutions’ for learning from AI feedback”. The growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have led to their use as substitutes for human feedback for training and assessing other LLMs. These methods often rely on ‘constitutions’, written guidelines which a critic model uses to provide feedback and improve generations. The work investigates how the choice of constitution affects feedback quality by using four different constitutions to improve patient-centered communication in medical interviews. In pairwise comparisons conducted by 215 human raters, the work found that detailed constitutions led to better results regarding emotive qualities. However, none of the constitutions outperformed the baseline in learning more practically-oriented skills related to information gathering and provision. The findings indicate that while detailed constitutions should be prioritised, there are possible limitations to the effectiveness of AI feedback as a reward signal in certain areas. <br> <br>

35. ***Collaborative study simulates behaviors of 1,000 individuals using generative agents: <br>
Stanford, Northwestern, University of Washington, and Google introduced a novel agent architecture simulating the behaviors and attitudes of 1,052 real individuals. By applying LLMs to qualitative interviews, the agents replicated participants’ survey responses with 85% accuracy and performed comparably in predicting personality traits and experimental outcomes. The architecture also reduced biases across racial and ideological groups compared to demographic-based models. This work lays the groundwork for tools to analyze individual and collective behavior for applications in policymaking and social science.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 14, Stanford Uni, Northwestern Uni, Uni of Washington, and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10109) “Generative Agent Simulations of 1,000 People”. The promise of human behavioral simulation--general-purpose computational agents that replicate human behavior across domains--could enable broad applications in policymaking and social science. The study presents a novel agent architecture that simulates the attitudes and behaviors of 1,052 real individuals--applying large language models to qualitative interviews about their lives, then measuring how well these agents replicate the attitudes and behaviors of the individuals that they represent. The generative agents replicate participants' responses on the General Social Survey 85% as accurately as participants replicate their own answers two weeks later, and perform comparably in predicting personality traits and outcomes in experimental replications. The architecture reduces accuracy biases across racial and ideological groups compared to agents given demographic descriptions. This work provides a foundation for new tools that can help investigate individual and collective behavior.

3. ***AI agents redefine productivity.  <br>Deloitte reports that multiagent AI systems are reshaping industries by enabling collaborative and complex tasks. Although technical challenges remain, the report forecasts rapid advancements, driven by growing investments and breakthroughs in reasoning capabilities. Businesses are urged to prepare for transformative impacts within a year.*** <br> <br>
   Nov 14, Deloitte published a [report](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/consulting/us-ai-institute-generative-ai-agents-multiagent-systems.pdf) “Prompting for action How AI agents are reshapingthe future of work”. The main points of the report are: 1) AI agents are reshaping industries by expanding the potential applications of Generative AI (GenAI) and typical language models. 2) Multiagent AI systems can significantly enhance the quality of outputs and complexity of work performed by single AI agents. 3) Forward-thinking businesses and governments are already implementing AI agents and multiagent AI systems across a range of use cases. 4) Executive leaders should make moves now to prepare for and embrace this next era of intelligent organizational transformation. The report indicates that the era of AI agent collaboration is still in its early stages. Interest is growing among businesses and technology providers, but comprehensive solutions are not yet common. There is much technical work to be done—particularly in terms of the reasoning and planning capabilities that will enable AI agents. Improvements are likely to come fast. In recent months GenAI tools have shown significant improvements in reasoning and agent orchestration capabilities. Many venture capital firms are investing heavily across the spectrum of AI agent-related technologies, as are many of today’s leading GenAI and technology providers. What is available today is only a glimpse of what’s to come. People anticipate a significant evolution of core language models, AI agents, and agent orchestration platforms within the next 12 months. <br> <br>

5. ***LLMs lack human-like understanding.  <br>A study assessing LLMs on comprehension tasks reveals they perform at chance levels and exhibit non-human errors. Despite their usefulness, LLMs lack compositional understanding and grammatical regulation, emphasizing their limitations compared to humans in interpreting underlying meaning.*** <br> <br>
   Nov 14, researcher from Spain, German and USA published a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-79531-8#:~:text=We%20interpret%20this%20evidence%20as,regulating%20grammatical%20and%20semantic%20information.) on scientific reports “Testing AI on language comprehension tasks reveals insensitivity to underlying meaning”. Large Language Models (LLMs) are recruited in applications that span from clinical assistance and legal support to question answering and education. Their success in specialized tasks has led to the claim that they possess human-like linguistic capabilities related to compositional understanding and reasoning. Yet, reverse-engineering is bound by Moravec’s Paradox, according to which easy skills are hard. The study systematically assesses 7 state-of-the-art models on a novel benchmark. Models answered a series of comprehension questions, each prompted multiple times in two settings, permitting one-word or open-length replies. Each question targets a short text featuring high-frequency linguistic constructions. To establish a baseline for achieving human-like performance, the study tested 400 humans on the same prompts. Based on a dataset of n = 26,680 datapoints, the study discovered that LLMs perform at chance accuracy and waver considerably in their answers. Quantitatively, the tested models are outperformed by humans, and qualitatively their answers showcase distinctly non-human errors in language understanding. The study interprets this evidence as suggesting that, despite their usefulness in various tasks, current AI models fall short of understanding language in a way that matches humans, and the authors argue that this may be due to their lack of a compositional operator for regulating grammatical and semantic information. <br> <br>

7. ***ChatGPT aids academic growth.  <br>OpenAI’s guide highlights strategies for using ChatGPT to enhance writing skills, from generating citations to testing logic and refining ideas. It emphasizes ethical usage, encouraging transparency in academic practices to balance ChatGPT’s assistance with independent learning.*** <br> <br>
   Nov 14, OpenAI released an [article](https://openai.com/chatgpt/use-cases/student-writing-guide/) “A Student’s Guide to Writing with ChatGPT” to help students becoming better writing and thinkers. The guide includes: 1) Delagate citation grunt work ChatGPT; 2) Quickly get up to speed on a new topic; 3) Get a roadmap of relevant sources; 4) Complete your understanding by asking specific questions; 5) Improve your flow by getting feedback on structure; 6) Test your logic with reverse outlining; 7) Develop your ideas through Socratic dialogue; 8) Pressure-test your thesis by asking for counterarguments; 9) Compare your ideas against history’s greatest thinkers; 10) Elevate your writing through iterative feedback; 11) Use Advanced Voice Mode as a reading companion; 12) Don’t just go through the motions—hone your skills. One last point: When you use ChatGPT to deepen your understanding, develop your ideas, or come to insights you might not otherwise have had, it should fall within the bounds of acceptable academic practices. But since ChatGPT can also be used in unethical ways, your professors will likely feel more comfortable if they can see exactly how it’s contributing to your thinking. <br> <br>

    Nov 14, Forbes published [an article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quickerbettertech/2024/11/14/how-ai-agents-will-disrupt-small-and-mid-sized-business-in-2025/) “How AI Agents Will Disrupt Small And Mid-Sized Business In 2025”. In 2025, small and mid-sized businesses will see a transformative shift with the introduction of AI agents, enabling them to automate tasks similarly to large corporations. Unlike current generative AI chatbots, AI agents will perform complex tasks, initiate transactions, and solve problems, acting more like human assistants. Companies like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Intuit are developing AI agents to enhance productivity and profitability, offering features that will keep customers engaged and subscribed. These agents will handle various functions, from qualifying leads and managing finances to scheduling meetings and processing invoices. The healthcare and software development sectors are also seeing advancements with AI agents taking on roles traditionally held by humans. While there is concern about job displacement, business owners can mitigate this by training employees to work alongside AI. The adoption of AI agents will move AI from corporate environments to everyday business operations, making it crucial for small business owners to engage with their software vendors to leverage these new tools effectively. The big worry is the potential job loss, but for businesses facing labor shortages, AI agents will be invaluable. Business owners must address employee concerns by providing training and demonstrating the benefits of AI. The reality is that AI agents will start moving AI from the corporate boardroom to Main Street, and while the transition won't be immediate or flawless, it will be significant. Small business owners should proactively discuss AI agents with their software vendors to understand and apply these capabilities in 2025. <br> <br>

13. ***FinDVer benchmarks LLM claim verification.  <br>Yale's FinDVer evaluates LLMs' ability to verify claims in complex financial documents. Results show significant gaps between LLM and human performance, but the benchmark offers insights into advancing LLM capabilities for expert-domain applications.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 13, Yale Uni published a [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.818.pdf) “FinDVer: Explainable Claim Verification over Long and Hybrid-Content Financial Documents”. The work introduces FinDVer, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the explainable claim verification capabilities of LLMs in the context of understanding and analyzing long, hybrid-content financial documents. FinDVer contains 4,000 expert-annotated examples across four subsets, each focusing on a type of scenario that frequently arises in real-world financial domains. The study assesses a broad spectrum of 25 LLMs under long-context and RAG settings. The results show that even the current best-performing system (i.e., GPT-4o) significantly lags behind human experts. The detailed findings and insights highlight the strengths and limitations of existing LLMs in this new task. The researchers believe FinDVer can serve as a valuable benchmark for evaluating LLM capabilities in claim verification over complex, expert-domain documents.  <br> <br>

15. ***CCE slashes training memory needs.  <br>Apple proposes the Cut Cross-Entropy (CCE) method to dramatically lower memory usage in LLM training. By computing loss on-the-fly, CCE reduces the memory footprint without affecting performance, enabling efficient training for large vocabulary models.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 13, Apple published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.09009) “Cut Your Losses in Large-Vocabulary Language Models”. As language models grow ever larger, so do their vocabularies. This has shifted the memory footprint of LLMs during training disproportionately to one single layer: the cross-entropy in the loss computation. Cross-entropy builds up a logit matrix with entries for each pair of input tokens and vocabulary items and, for small models, consumes an order of magnitude more memory than the rest of the LLM combined. The work proposes Cut Cross-Entropy (CCE), a method that computes the cross-entropy loss without materializing the logits for all tokens into global memory. Rather, CCE only computes the logit for the correct token and evaluates the log-sum-exp over all logits on the fly. The study implements a custom kernel that performs the matrix multiplications and the log-sum-exp reduction over the vocabulary in flash memory, making global memory consumption for the cross-entropy computation negligible. This has a dramatic effect. Taking the Gemma 2 (2B) model as an example, CCE reduces the memory footprint of the loss computation from 24 GB to 1 MB, and the total training-time memory consumption of the classifier head from 28 GB to 1 GB. To improve the throughput of CCE, the study leverages the inherent sparsity of softmax and propose to skip elements of the gradient computation that have a negligible (i.e., below numerical precision) contribution to the gradient. Experiments demonstrate that the dramatic reduction in memory consumption is accomplished without sacrificing training speed or convergence. Here is [code](https://github.com/apple/ml-cross-entropy). <br> <br>

17. ***LLMs simulate journalistic planning.  <br>Research investigates how journalists select sources in news writing and applies Bayesian methods to predict source-selection schemas. The study provides a framework for understanding planning in long-form text generation, with implications for improving LLM-generated content.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 13, Uni of Southern California, UC Berkeley and Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.930.pdf) “Explaining Mixtures of Sources in News Articles”. Human writers plan, then write. For large language models (LLMs) to play a role in longer-form article generation, people must understand the planning steps humans make before writing. The study explores one kind of planning, source-selection in news, as a case-study for evaluating plans in long-form generation. The authors ask: why do specific stories call for specific kinds of sources? The study imagines a generative process for story writing where a source-selection schema is first selected by a journalist, and then sources are chosen based on categories in that schema. Learning the article’s plan means predicting the schema initially chosen by the journalist. Working with professional journalists, the study adapt five existing schemata and introduce three new ones to describe journalistic plans for the inclusion of sources in documents. Then, inspired by Bayesian latent-variable modeling, the study develops metrics to select the most likely plan, or schema, underlying a story, which is used to compare schemata. The study finds that two schemata: stance and social affiliation best explain source plans in most documents. However, other schemata like textual entailment explain source plans in factually rich topics like “Science”. Finally, the study finds the authors can predict the most suitable schema given just the article’s headline with reasonable accuracy. This can been seen as an important case-study for human planning, and provides a framework and approach for evaluating other kinds of plans. The authors release a corpora, NewsSources, with annotations for 4M articles. <br> <br>

19. ***TTT enhances reasoning in novel tasks.  <br>MIT demonstrates that test-time training (TTT) significantly improves LLM performance on abstract reasoning benchmarks like ARC. By adapting model parameters during inference, TTT achieves state-of-the-art results, suggesting an alternative to symbolic reasoning.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 12, MIT published a [paper](https://ekinakyurek.github.io/papers/ttt.pdf) “The Surprising Effectiveness of Test-Time Training for Abstract Reasoning”. Language models have shown impressive performance on tasks within their training distribution, but often struggle with novel problems requiring complex reasoning. The study investigates the effectiveness of test-time training (TTT)—updating model parameters temporarily during inference using a loss derived from input data—as a mechanism for improving models’ reasoning capabilities, using the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) as a benchmark. Through systematic experimentation, the study identifies three crucial components for successful TTT: (1) initial finetuning on similar tasks (2) auxiliary task format and augmentations (3) per-instance training. TTT significantly improves performance on ARC tasks, achieving up to 6× improvement in accuracy compared to base fine-tuned models; applying TTT to a 8B-parameter language model, the study achieves 53% accuracy on the ARC’s public validation set, improving the state-of-the-art by nearly 25% for public and purely neural approaches. By ensembling the method with recent program generation approaches, the study gets SoTA public validation accuracy of 61.9%, matching the average human score. The findings suggest that explicit symbolic search is not the only path to improved abstract reasoning in neural language models; additional test-time applied to continued training on few-shot examples can also be extremely effective. <br> <br>

21. ***Bigger models aren't always better teachers.  <br>A study challenges assumptions that larger LLMs are better for instruction tuning. Findings show that compatibility between teacher and base models is more crucial than size, prompting the development of new evaluation metrics like Compatibility-Adjusted Reward (CAR).*** <br> <br>
    Nov 12, Uni of Washington and Allen Inst for AI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07133) “Stronger Models are NOT Stronger Teachers for Instruction Tuning”. Instruction tuning has been widely adopted to ensure large language models (LLMs) follow user instructions effectively. The resulting instruction-following capabilities of LLMs heavily rely on the instruction datasets used for tuning. Recently, synthetic instruction datasets have emerged as an economically viable solution to provide LLMs diverse and high-quality instructions. However, existing approaches typically assume that larger or stronger models are stronger teachers for instruction tuning, and hence simply adopt these models as response generators to the synthetic instructions. This study challenges this commonly-adopted assumption. The extensive experiments across five base models and twenty response generators reveal that larger and stronger models are not necessarily stronger teachers of smaller models. The authors refer to this phenomenon as the Larger Models' Paradox and observe that existing metrics cannot precisely predict the effectiveness of response generators since they ignore the compatibility between teachers and base models being fine-tuned. The study thus develops a novel metric, named as Compatibility-Adjusted Reward (CAR) to measure the effectiveness of response generators. Experiments across five base models demonstrate that CAR outperforms almost all baselines. Main finds include1) larger response generators not equal improved instruction-following capabilities; 2) learning from response generators within the same model family leads to higher performance; 3) Open-source LLMs can outperform close-source LLMs as response generators; 4) Higher temperature and top-p enhance instruction-following capabilities. <br> <br>

23. ***LLMs show limited implicit communication skills.  <br>Arizona State's study introduces ExpressivityArena to assess LLMs’ ability to convey implicit cues in tasks like poetry and coding. While LLMs demonstrate some expressive capabilities, limitations remain, guiding future research on enhancing conversational nuance.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 12, Arizona State Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.08010v1) “ExpressivityArena: Can LLMs Express Information Implicitly?”. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in certain dimensions, their ability to express implicit language cues that human use for effective communication remains unclear. This paper presents ExpressivityArena, a Python library for measuring the implicit communication abilities of LLMs. The study provides a comprehensive framework to evaluate expressivity of arbitrary LLMs and explore its practical implications. To this end, the authors refine the definition and measurements of “expressivity,” and use the framework in a set of small experiments. These experiments test LLMs in creative and logical tasks such as poetry, coding, and emotion-based responses. They are then evaluated by an automated grader, through ExpressivityArena, which the work verifies to be the most pragmatic for testing expressivity. Building on these experiments, the work deepen the understanding of the expressivity of LLMs by assessing their ability to remain expressive in conversations. The findings indicate that LLMs are capable of generating and understanding expressive content, however, with some limitations. These insights will inform the future development and deployment of expressive LLMs.  <br> <br>

25. ***WAM enables precise watermarking.  <br>The Watermark Anything Model (WAM) introduces advanced localized image watermarking. Capable of embedding imperceptible messages into small areas, WAM offers robust watermarking even under challenging conditions, broadening applications in digital content security.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 11, Meta, Ecole Polytechnique and Inria Rennes published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07231) “Watermark Anything with Localized Messages”. Image watermarking methods are not tailored to handle small watermarked areas. This restricts applications in real-world scenarios where parts of the image may come from different sources or have been edited. The study introduces a deep-learning model for localized image watermarking, dubbed the Watermark Anything Model (WAM). The WAM embedder imperceptibly modifies the input image, while the extractor segments the received image into watermarked and non-watermarked areas and recovers one or several hidden messages from the areas found to be watermarked. The models are jointly trained at low resolution and without perceptual constraints, then post-trained for imperceptibility and multiple watermarks. Experiments show that WAM is competitive with state-of-the art methods in terms of imperceptibility and robustness, especially against inpainting and splicing, even on high-resolution images. Moreover, it offers new capabilities: WAM can locate watermarked areas in spliced images and extract distinct 32-bit messages with less than 1 bit error from multiple small regions - no larger than 10% of the image surface - even for small 256times 256 images. <br> <br>

27. ***Fine-tuning struggles to update LLMs reliably.  <br>Stanford’s FineTuneBench reveals that commercial fine-tuning APIs are inefficient at learning new or updated knowledge, with low generalization accuracy. The findings highlight limitations in current methods and underscore the need for more effective fine-tuning strategies.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 11, Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05059) “FineTuneBench: How well do commercial fine-tuning APIs infuse knowledge into LLMs?”. There is great interest in fine-tuning frontier large language models (LLMs) to inject new information and update existing knowledge. While commercial LLM fine-tuning APIs from providers such as OpenAI and Google promise flexible adaptation for various applications, the efficacy of fine-tuning remains unclear. This study introduces FineTuneBench, an evaluation framework and dataset for understanding how well commercial fine-tuning APIs can successfully learn new and updated knowledge. The work analyzes five frontier LLMs with commercially available fine-tuning APIs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, on their effectiveness in two settings: (1) ingesting novel information, such as recent news events and new people profiles, and (2) updating existing knowledge, such as updated medical guidelines and code frameworks. The results reveal substantial shortcomings in all the models' abilities to effectively learn new information through fine-tuning, with an average generalization accuracy of 37% across all models. When updating existing knowledge, such as incorporating medical guideline updates, commercial fine-tuning APIs show even more limited capability (average generalization accuracy of 19%). Overall, fine-tuning GPT-4o mini is the most effective for infusing new knowledge and updating knowledge, followed by GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o. The fine-tuning APIs for Gemini 1.5 Flesh and Gemini 1.5 Pro are unable to learn new knowledge or update existing knowledge. These findings underscore a major shortcoming in using current commercial fine-tuning services to achieve reliable knowledge infusion in common scenarios.

29. ***REMIX mitigates knowledge loss.  <br>Princeton introduces REMIX, a strategy for preventing LLM forgetting during continual training. By mixing unrelated data into the learning process, REMIX reduces interference and enhances memory retention, paving the way for more robust knowledge updates.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 11, Princeton Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07175) “Continual Memorization of Factoids in Large Language Models”. Large language models can absorb a massive amount of knowledge through pretraining, but pretraining is inefficient for acquiring long-tailed or specialized facts. Therefore, fine-tuning on specialized or new knowledge that reflects changes in the world has become popular, though it risks disrupting the model's original capabilities. The authors study this fragility in the context of continual memorization, where the model is trained on a small set of long-tail factoids (factual associations) and must retain these factoids after multiple stages of subsequent training on other datasets. Through extensive experiments, the study shows that LLMs suffer from forgetting across a wide range of subsequent tasks, and simple replay techniques do not fully prevent forgetting, especially when the factoid datasets are trained in the later stages. The work posits that there are two ways to alleviate forgetting: 1) protect the memorization process as the model learns the factoids, or 2) reduce interference from training in later stages. With this insight, the study develops an effective mitigation strategy: REMIX (Random and Generic Data Mixing). REMIX prevents forgetting by mixing generic data sampled from pretraining corpora or even randomly generated word sequences during each stage, despite being unrelated to the memorized factoids in the first stage. REMIX can recover performance from severe forgetting, often outperforming replay-based methods that have access to the factoids from the first stage. The authors then analyze how REMIX alters the learning process and find that successful forgetting prevention is associated with a pattern: the model stores factoids in earlier layers than usual and diversifies the set of layers that store these factoids. The efficacy of REMIX invites further investigation into the underlying dynamics of memorization and forgetting, opening exciting possibilities for future research. <br> <br>

31. ***OpenAI's Challenge with Slowing AI Improvement.  <br>
OpenAI is reportedly encountering a slowdown in performance improvements for its models, with its upcoming model, "Orion," showing less advancement compared to previous transitions (e.g., GPT-3 to GPT-4). Orion's performance might even lag in specific areas like coding. OpenAI has formed a foundational team to address this by exploring strategies such as using synthetic data for training and enhancing post-training processes. The company has denied plans to release Orion this year.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 9, according to [techcrunch.com](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/09/openai-reportedly-developing-new-strategies-to-deal-with-ai-improvement-slowdown/), OpenAI reportedly developing new strategies to deal with AI improvement slowdown. OpenAI’s next flagship model might not represent as big a leap forward as its predecessors, according to a new report in The Information. Employees who tested the new model, code-named Orion, reportedly found that even though its performance exceeds OpenAI’s existing models, there was less improvement than they’d seen in the jump from GPT-3 to GPT-4. In other words, the rate of improvement seems to be slowing down. In fact, Orion might not be reliably better than previous models in some areas, such as coding. In response, OpenAI has created a foundations team to figure out how the company can continue to improve its models in the face of a dwindling supply of new training data. These new strategies reportedly include training Orion on synthetic data produced by AI models, as well as doing more to improve models during the post-training process. OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In response to previous reports about plans for its flagship model, the company said, “We don’t have plans to release a model code-named Orion this year.” <br> <br>

33. ***Efficient Inference with Recycled Attention.  <br>
A study by NYU, Cornell, and UT Austin introduces "Recycled Attention," an inference method for long-context language models. This approach alternates between full-context and partial attention, recycling patterns from prior computations to improve efficiency. It demonstrates superior speed and performance on long-context tasks compared to previous methods and explores dynamic attention-switching strategies and continued pretraining for further optimization.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 8, NYU, Uni of Cornell and Uni of Texas at Austin published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05787v1) “Recycled Attention: Efficient inference for long-context language models”. Generating long sequences of tokens given a long-context input imposes a heavy computational burden for large language models (LLMs). One of the computational bottleneck comes from computing attention over a long sequence of input at each generation step. This study proposes Recycled Attention, an inference-time method which alternates between full context attention and attention over a subset of input tokens. When performing partial attention, the approach recycles the attention pattern of a previous token that has performed full attention and attend only to the top K most attended tokens, reducing the cost of data movement and attention computation. Compared to previously proposed inference-time acceleration method which attends only to local context or tokens with high accumulative attention scores, the proposed approach flexibly chooses tokens that are relevant to the current decoding step. The study evaluate the methods on RULER, a suite of tasks designed to comprehensively evaluate long-context abilities, and long-context language modeling tasks. Applying the method to off-the-shelf LLMs achieves comparable speedup to baselines which only consider local context while improving the performance by 2x. The study further explores two ideas to improve performance-efficiency trade-offs: (1) dynamically decide when to perform recycled or full attention step based on the query similarities and (2) continued pre-training the model with Recycled Attention. <br> <br>

35. ***Precision-Aware Scaling Laws for LLMs.  <br>
Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Databricks, and CMU propose precision-aware scaling laws for low-precision training and inference, addressing cost and quality trade-offs in LLMs. These laws predict the quality degradation from reduced precision and show how post-training quantization degrades performance as training data scales. This unified model helps optimize training and inference across precisions.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 7, Harvard Uni, Stanford Uni, MIT, Databricks and CMU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04330) “Scaling Laws for Precision”. Low precision training and inference affect both the quality and cost of language models, but current scaling laws do not account for this. This study devises "precision-aware" scaling laws for both training and inference. The study proposes that training in lower precision reduces the model's "effective parameter count," allowing to predict the additional loss incurred from training in low precision and post-train quantization. For inference, the study finds that the degradation introduced by post-training quantization increases as models are trained on more data, eventually making additional pretraining data actively harmful. For training, the scaling laws allow to predict the loss of a model with different parts in different precisions, and suggest that training larger models in lower precision may be compute optimal. The authors unify the scaling laws for post and pretraining quantization to arrive at a single functional form that predicts degradation from training and inference in varied precisions. The study fits on over 465 pretraining runs and validate the predictions on model sizes up to 1.7B parameters trained on up to 26B tokens. <br> <br>

37. ***Identifying LLM Hosting Platforms.  <br>
Imperial College, Cambridge, and Google develop a method to verify the hardware and software platforms used in LLM inference. The technique, called Hardware and Software Platform Inference (HSPI), analyzes output patterns to identify GPU architectures and software stacks. Testing shows up to 100% accuracy in white-box scenarios and significant success in black-box cases, addressing concerns over mismatched services in AI hosting.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 7, Imperial College London, Uni of Cambridge and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05197) “Hardware and Software Platform Inference”. It is now a common business practice to buy access to large language model (LLM) inference rather than self-host, because of significant upfront hardware infrastructure and energy costs. However, as a buyer, there is no mechanism to verify the authenticity of the advertised service including the serving hardware platform, e.g. that it is actually being served using an NVIDIA H100. Furthermore, there are reports suggesting that model providers may deliver models that differ slightly from the advertised ones, often to make them run on less expensive hardware. That way, a client pays premium for a capable model access on more expensive hardware, yet ends up being served by a (potentially less capable) cheaper model on cheaper hardware. This work introduces hardware and software platform inference (HSPI) -- a method for identifying the underlying GPU architecture and software stack of a (black-box) machine learning model solely based on its input-output behavior. The method leverages the inherent differences of various GPU architectures and compilers to distinguish between different GPU types and software stacks. By analyzing the numerical patterns in the model's outputs, the study proposes a classification framework capable of accurately identifying the GPU used for model inference as well as the underlying software configuration. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of inferring GPU type from black-box models. The authors evaluate HSPI against models served on different real hardware and find that in a white-box setting the researcher can distinguish between different GPUs with between 83.9% and 100% accuracy. Even in a black-box setting the model is able to achieve results that are up to three times higher than random guess accuracy. <br> <br>

39. ***Unlocking Latent Reasoning in LLMs.  <br>
Salesforce introduces LaTent Reasoning Optimization (LaTRO), a framework enhancing LLM reasoning through self-reward mechanisms rather than external feedback. LaTRO achieves significant accuracy gains on reasoning datasets like GSM8K, demonstrating LLMs' untapped reasoning potential. This approach offers a scalable, self-improvement pathway for reasoning tasks, with code available on GitHub.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 6, Saleforce published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04282) “Language Models are Hidden Reasoners: Unlocking Latent Reasoning Capabilities via Self-Rewarding”. Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, but still struggle with complex reasoning tasks requiring multiple steps. While prompt-based methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can improve LLM reasoning at inference time, optimizing reasoning capabilities during training remains challenging. The work introduces LaTent Reasoning Optimization (LaTRO), a principled framework that formulates reasoning as sampling from a latent distribution and optimizes it via variational approaches. LaTRO enables LLMs to concurrently improve both their reasoning process and ability to evaluate reasoning quality, without requiring external feedback or reward models. The study validates LaTRO through experiments on GSM8K and ARC-Challenge datasets using multiple model architectures. On GSM8K, LaTRO improves zero-shot accuracy by an average of 12.5% over base models and 9.6% over supervised fine-tuning across Phi-3.5-mini, Mistral-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B. The findings suggest that pre-trained LLMs possess latent reasoning capabilities that can be unlocked and enhanced through the proposed optimization approach in a self-improvement manner. The code of LaTRO is available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/LaTRO. <br> <br>
    
41. ***Counting Abilities and Tokenization in LLMs.  <br>
A study by UBC and Stony Brook University examines how Transformers' architectural limitations affect counting tasks, a critical reasoning component. While Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning partially addresses these issues, tokenization strategies (e.g., byte-level vs. character-level) significantly impact performance. The findings suggest revisiting tokenization methods to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities.*** <br> <br>
    21.	Oct 29, Uni of British Columbia and Stony Brook Uni published a paper “Counting Ability of Large Language Models and Impact of Tokenization”. Transformers, the backbone of modern large language models (LLMs), face inherent architectural limitations that impede their reasoning capabilities. Unlike recurrent networks, Transformers lack recurrent connections, confining them to constant-depth computation. This restriction places them in the complexity class TC0, making them theoretically incapable of solving tasks that demand increasingly deep reasoning as input length grows. Counting, a fundamental component of many reasoning tasks, also requires reasoning depth to grow linearly to be performed inductively. While previous studies have established the upper limits of counting ability in Transformer-based expert models (i.e., models specifically trained for counting tasks), these findings do not directly extend to general-purpose LLMs due to differences in reasoning mechanisms. Recent work has highlighted how Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning can help alleviate some of the architectural limitations of Transformers in counting tasks. However, little attention has been paid to the role of tokenization in these models. Unlike expert models that often use character-level tokenization, LLMs typically rely on byte-level (BPE) tokenizers, which fundamentally alters the way reasoning is processed. This work investigates the impact of tokenization on the counting abilities of LLMs, uncovering substantial performance variations based on input tokenization differences. The work provides both theoretical and experimental analyses, offering insights into how tokenization choices can undermine models' theoretical computability, thereby inspiring the design of new tokenization methods to enhance reasoning in LLMs.

1. ***Meta and Stanford propose a sparse multi-modal transformer architecture to optimize computational efficiency:  <br>The paper introduces the Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT), which decouples non-embedding parameters for different modalities, improving multi-modal processing efficiency. In tests, MoT achieves similar performance to dense models with significantly reduced FLOPs and faster processing times on large datasets.*** <br> <br>
   Nov 8, Meta and Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04996) “Mixture-of-Transformers: A Sparse and Scalable Architecture for Multi-Modal Foundation Models”.  The development of large language models (LLMs) has expanded to multi-modal systems capable of processing text, images, and speech within a unified framework. Training these models demands significantly larger datasets and computational resources compared to text-only LLMs. To address the scaling challenges, the study introduces Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT), a sparse multi-modal transformer architecture that significantly reduces pretraining computational costs. MoT decouples non-embedding parameters of the model by modality -- including feed-forward networks, attention matrices, and layer normalization -- enabling modality-specific processing with global self-attention over the full input sequence. The study evaluates MoT across multiple settings and model scales. In the Chameleon 7B setting (autoregressive text-and-image generation), MoT matches the dense baseline's performance using only 55.8% of the FLOPs. When extended to include speech, MoT reaches speech performance comparable to the dense baseline with only 37.2% of the FLOPs. In the Transfusion setting, where text and image are trained with different objectives, a 7B MoT model matches the image modality performance of the dense baseline with one third of the FLOPs, and a 760M MoT model outperforms a 1.4B dense baseline across key image generation metrics. System profiling further highlights MoT's practical benefits, achieving dense baseline image quality in 47.2% of the wall-clock time and text quality in 75.6% of the wall-clock time (measured on AWS p4de.24xlarge instances with NVIDIA A100 GPUs). <br> <br>

3. ***MIT, Harvard, and Johns Hopkins present an inverse generative model for few-shot task learning:  <br>Their Few-Shot Task Learning through Inverse Generative Modeling (FTL-IGM) learns new task concepts with few examples using pre-trained generative models, improving agent behavior prediction across varied domains like navigation and manipulation.*** <br> <br>
   Nov 7, MIT, Harvard Uni and Johns Hopkins Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04987v1) “Few-Shot Task Learning through Inverse Generative Modeling”. Learning the intents of an agent, defined by its goals or motion style, is often extremely challenging from just a few examples. The study refers to this problem as task concept learning and present an approach, Few-Shot Task Learning through Inverse Generative Modeling (FTL-IGM), which learns new task concepts by leveraging invertible neural generative models. The core idea is to pretrain a generative model on a set of basic concepts and their demonstrations. Then, given a few demonstrations of a new concept (such as a new goal or a new action), the method learns the underlying concepts through backpropagation without updating the model weights, thanks to the invertibility of the generative model. The authors evaluate the method in five domains – object rearrangement, goal-oriented navigation, motion caption of human actions, autonomous driving, and real-world table-top manipulation. The experimental results demonstrate that via the pretrained generative model, the study successfully learns novel concepts and generate agent plans or motion corresponding to these concepts in (1) unseen environments and (2) in composition with training concepts. <br> <br>

5. ***MIT and partners hypothesize that language models share semantic representations across languages and modalities:  <br>Known as the "semantic hub hypothesis," this shared space enables language models to process inputs from different languages and modalities, creating predictable cross-modal effects in model outputs.*** <br> <br>
   Nov 7, MIT, Uni of Southern California and Allen Inst for AI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04986v1) “The Semantic Hub Hypothesis: Language Models Share Semantic Representations Across Languages and Modalities”. Modern language models can process inputs across diverse languages and modalities. The study hypothesizes that models acquire this capability through learning a shared representation space across heterogeneous data types (e.g., different languages and modalities), which places semantically similar inputs near one another, even if they are from different modalities/languages. The authors term this the semantic hub hypothesis, following the hub-and-spoke model from neuroscience (Patterson et al., 2007) which posits that semantic knowledge in the human brain is organized through a transmodal semantic “hub” which integrates information from various modality-specific “spokes” regions. The study first shows that model representations for semantically equivalent inputs in different languages are similar in the intermediate layers, and that this space can be interpreted using the model’s dominant pretraining language via the logit lens. This tendency extends to other data types, including arithmetic expressions, code, and visual/audio inputs. Interventions in the shared representation space in one data type also predictably affect model outputs in other data types, suggesting that this shared representations space is not simply a vestigial byproduct of large-scale training on broad data, but something that is actively utilized by the model during input processing. <br> <br>

7. ***Cambridge and HKU explore LLMs' capabilities in following threads in extensive contexts:  <br>Their research finds that while many LLMs handle multiple threads well, accuracy declines as the context window grows. The study also shows that token counts from different tokenizers vary significantly, impacting context limits.*** <br> <br>
   Nov 7, Uni of Cambridge and The Uni of Hong Kong published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05000) “Needle Threading: Can LLMs Follow Threads through Near-Million-Scale Haystacks?”. As the context limits of Large Language Models (LLMs) increase, the range of possible applications and downstream functions broadens. In many real-world tasks, decisions depend on details scattered across collections of often disparate documents containing mostly irrelevant information. Long-context LLMs appear well-suited to this form of complex information retrieval and reasoning, which has traditionally proven costly and time-consuming. However, although the development of longer context models has seen rapid gains in recent years, the understanding of how effectively LLMs use their context has not kept pace. To address this, the study conducts a set of retrieval experiments designed to evaluate the capabilities of 17 leading LLMs, such as their ability to follow threads of information through the context window. Strikingly, the work finds that many models are remarkably threadsafe: capable of simultaneously following multiple threads without significant loss in performance. Still, for many models, the study finds the effective context limit is significantly shorter than the supported context length, with accuracy decreasing as the context window grows. The study also highlights the important point that token counts from different tokenizers should not be directly compared -- they often correspond to substantially different numbers of written characters. The authors release the code and long-context experimental data. <br> <br>

9. ***Meta, UNC, and NYU introduce Self-Consistency Preference Optimization (ScPO) for unsupervised model improvement:  <br>ScPO iteratively trains models to prioritize consistent over inconsistent answers, closing the gap with supervised models on reasoning tasks and showing notable improvements in reasoning accuracy.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 6, Meta, UNC Chapel Hill and NYU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04109) “Self-Consistency Preference Optimization”.  Self-alignment, whereby models learn to improve themselves without human annotation, is a rapidly growing research area. However, existing techniques often fail to improve complex reasoning tasks due to the difficulty of assigning correct rewards. An orthogonal approach that is known to improve correctness is self-consistency, a method applied at inference time based on multiple sampling in order to find the most consistent answer. This work extends the self-consistency concept to help train models. The study thus introduces self-consistency preference optimization (ScPO), which iteratively trains consistent answers to be preferred over inconsistent ones on unsupervised new problems. The work shows ScPO leads to large improvements over conventional reward model training on reasoning tasks such as GSM8K and MATH, closing the gap with supervised training with gold answers or preferences, and that combining ScPO with standard supervised learning improves results even further. On ZebraLogic, ScPO finetunes Llama-3 8B to be superior to Llama-3 70B, Gemma-2 27B, and Claude-3 Haiku. <br> <br>

11. ***UCL, Boston University, and Meta analyze the effects of evaluation data contamination in LLMs:  <br>Using a novel ConTAM metric, the study shows how contamination impacts benchmark scores and suggests that longer contaminated strings provide clearer insights into performance inflation.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 6, UCL, Boston Uni, Cohere and Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03923v1) “Evaluation data contamination in LLMs: how do we measure it and (when) does it matter?”. Evaluation data contamination, the inadvertent mixing of samples from evaluation benchmarks into pre-training corpora, constitutes a recently growing and important concern in the field of evaluating large language models (LLMs). The resulting ‘training on the test set’ makes it difficult to interpret evaluation benchmark scores, and an active area of research studies its effects. However, while evaluation data contamination is easily understood intuitively, it is surprisingly difficult to define precisely which examples should be considered contaminated and, consequently, to what extent contamination inflates the corresponding benchmark scores. This work proposes that these questions should be addressed together and that contamination metrics can be assessed based on whether the examples they mark contaminated indeed give models an undue advantage. The study proposes a novel analysis method called ConTAM, and shows – in a large scale survey of existing and novel n-gram based contamination metrics across 13 benchmarks and 7 models from 2 different families – that ConTAM can be used to better understand evaluation data contamination as well as its effects on benchmark scores. The study finds that contamination may have a much larger effect than reported in recent LLM releases and that there are differences in the extent to which models at different scale are impacted by contamination. Furthermore, the authors find that considering only the longest contaminated substring generally provides a better signal than considering a union of all contaminated substrings, as was common practice in previous studies, and that doing model and benchmark specific threshold analysis greatly increases the specificity of the results. Lastly, the study investigates the impact of various hyperparameter choices of contamination studies, finding that – among other things – both using larger values of n and disregarding contaminated strings that are infrequent in the pre-training data lead to many false negatives. With ConTAM, the work provides a method to empirically ground evaluation data contamination metrics in downstream effects as well as measure their magnitude. With the exploration, the work sheds light on how evaluation data contamination can impact LLMs and provide insight into the various considerations important when doing contamination analysis. The authors end the paper by discussing these in more detail and providing concrete suggestions for future work. <br> <br>

13. ***Peking University examines large language models' numerical understanding with the Number Cookbook benchmark:  <br>The study highlights LLMs' weaknesses in basic numerical processing, offering a new benchmark to evaluate models and exploring techniques like chain-of-thought to improve numerical understanding.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 6, Peking Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03766v1) “Number Cookbook: Number Understanding of Language Models and How to Improve It”. Large language models (LLMs) can solve an increasing number of complex reasoning tasks while making surprising mistakes in basic numerical understanding and processing (such as 9.11> 9.9). The latter ability is essential for tackling complex arithmetic and mathematical problems and serves as a foundation for most reasoning tasks, but previous work paid little attention to it or only discussed several restricted tasks (like integer addition). This paper comprehensively investigates the numerical understanding and processing ability (NUPA) of LLMs. Firstly, the study introduces a benchmark covering four common numerical representations and 17 distinct numerical tasks in four major categories, resulting in 41 meaningful combinations in total. These tasks are derived from primary and secondary education curricula, encompassing nearly all everyday numerical understanding and processing scenarios, and the rules of these tasks are very simple and clear. Through the benchmark, the work finds that current LLMs fail frequently in many of the tasks. To study the problem, the work trains small models with existing and potential techniques for enhancing NUPA (such as special tokenizers, PEs, and number formats), comprehensively evaluating their effectiveness using the testbed. The study also finetunes practical-scale LLMs on the proposed NUPA tasks and find that 1) naive finetuning can improve NUPA a lot on many but not all tasks, and 2) surprisingly, techniques designed to enhance NUPA prove ineffective for finetuning pretrained models. The study further explores the impact of chain-of-thought techniques on NUPA. The work takes a preliminary step towards understanding and improving NUPA of LLMs. The benchmark and code are released at https://github.com/GraphPKU/number_cookbook. <br> <br>

15. ***UCL and Google propose a soft parameter reset for non-stationary learning in neural networks:  <br>This technique adapts to non-stationary distributions by reverting parameters towards initial values, improving performance in non-stationary learning scenarios like continual learning and contextual bandits.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 6, UCL and Google published a [paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=fDiZJ7mmOV) on NeurIPS “Non-Stationary Learning of Neural Networks with Automatic Soft Parameter Reset”. Neural networks are traditionally trained under the assumption that data come from a stationary distribution. However, settings which violate this assumption are becoming more popular; examples include supervised learning under distributional shifts, reinforcement learning, continual learning and non-stationary contextual bandits. This study introduces a novel learning approach that automatically models and adapts to non-stationarity, via an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with an adaptive drift parameter. The adaptive drift tends to draw the parameters towards the initialisation distribution, so the approach can be understood as a form of soft parameter reset. The authors show empirically that the approach performs well in non-stationary supervised and off-policy reinforcement learning settings. <br> <br>

17. ***Stanford introduces a gradient method with online scaling for accelerated convergence:  <br>This approach optimally scales gradients at each iteration, achieving faster convergence in optimization tasks compared to traditional methods, especially in smooth convex optimization.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 5, Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.01803) “Gradient Methods with Online Scaling”. The study introduces a framework to accelerate the convergence of gradient-based methods with online learning. The framework learns to scale the gradient at each iteration through an online learning algorithm and provably accelerates gradient-based methods asymptotically. In contrast with previous literature, where convergence is established based on worst-case analysis, this framework provides a strong convergence guarantee with respect to the optimal scaling matrix for the iteration trajectory. For smooth strongly convex optimization, the results provide an O(κ⋆log(1/ε)) complexity result, where κ⋆ is the condition number achievable by the optimal preconditioner, improving on the previous O(√nκ⋆log(1/ε)) result. In particular, a variant of the method achieves superlinear convergence on convex quadratics. For smooth convex optimization, the work shows for the first time that the widely-used hypergradient descent heuristic improves on the convergence of gradient descent. <br> <br>

19. ***CMU and Bosch suggest VLMs can perform optimally with fewer visual tokens and larger models:  <br>They find that reducing visual tokens while maximizing model size minimizes inference compute without sacrificing performance, challenging current token reduction practices.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 5, CMU and Bosch published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03312) “Inference Optimal VLMs Need Only One Visual Token but Larger Models”. Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across various visual understanding and reasoning tasks. However, their real-world deployment is often constrained by high latency during inference due to substantial compute required to process the large number of input tokens (predominantly from the image) by the LLM. To reduce inference costs, one can either downsize the LLM or reduce the number of input image-tokens, the latter of which has been the focus of many recent works around token compression. However, it is unclear what the optimal trade-off is, as both the factors directly affect the VLM performance. The study first characterizes this optimal trade-off between the number of visual tokens and LLM parameters by establishing scaling laws that capture variations in performance with these two factors. The results reveal a surprising trend: for visual reasoning tasks, the inference-optimal behavior in VLMs, i.e., minimum downstream error at any given fixed inference compute, is achieved when using the largest LLM that fits within the inference budget while minimizing visual token count - often to a single token. While the token reduction literature has mainly focused on maintaining base model performance by modestly reducing the token count (e.g., 5-10times), the results indicate that the compute-optimal inference regime requires operating under even higher token compression ratios. Based on these insights, the study takes some initial steps towards building approaches tailored for high token compression settings. Code is available at https://github.com/locuslab/llava-token-compression. <br> <br>

21. ***University of Tokyo develops ADOPT, an adaptive gradient method ensuring convergence without bounded gradient assumptions:  <br>ADOPT improves on Adam's convergence across tasks by altering momentum calculations, proving effective in tasks like image classification and NLP.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 5, The of Tokyo published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02853) “ADOPT: Modified Adam Can Converge with Any β2 with the Optimal Rate”. Adaptive gradient methods based on exponential moving averages, such as Adam and RMSprop, are widely used for deep learning. However, it is known that they do not converge unless choosing hyperparameters in a problem-dependent manner. There have been many attempts to fix their convergence (e.g., AMSGrad), but they require an impractical assumption that the stochastic gradient is uniformly bounded. This study propose as new adaptive gradient method named ADOPT, which achieves the optimal convergence rate of O(1/√T)  with any hyperparameter choice without the bounded stochastic gradient assumption. ADOPT addresses the non-convergence issue of Adam by removing the current gradient from the second moment estimate and changing the order of the momentum calculation and the scaling operation by the second moment estimate. The study also conducts intensive numerical experiments, and verify that ADOPT achieves competitive or even better results compared to Adam and its variants across a wide range of tasks, including image classification, generative modeling, natural language processing, and deep reinforcement learning. <br> <br>

23. ***Databricks examines long-context RAG performance in LLMs and its limitations:  <br>Findings reveal that few models maintain accuracy above 64k tokens, identifying long-context scenarios where RAG remains beneficial but challenging.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 5, Databricks published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03538v1) “Long Context RAG Performance of Large Language Models”. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial technique for enhancing the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external information. With the advent of LLMs that support increasingly longer context lengths, there is a growing interest in understanding how these models perform in RAG scenarios. Can these new long context models improve RAG performance? This paper presents a comprehensive study of the impact of increased context length on RAG performance across 20 popular open source and commercial LLMs. The study ran RAG workflows while varying the total context length from 2,000 to 128,000 tokens (and 2 million tokens when possible) on three domain-specific datasets, and reports key insights on the benefits and limitations of long context in RAG applications. The findings reveal that while retrieving more documents can improve performance, only a handful of the most recent state of the art LLMs can maintain consistent accuracy at long context above 64k tokens. The authors also identify distinct failure modes in long context scenarios, suggesting areas for future research. <br> <br>

25. ***Neural Magic and IST Austria study trade-offs in LLM quantization for faster inference:  <br>Evaluating formats like FP8 and INT8, they find that lower-bit quantization maintains performance well, with INT4 offering cost-efficient deployment, especially in asynchronous scenarios.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 4, Neural Magic and Inst of Sci and Tech Austria published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02355) “"Give Me BF16 or Give Me Death"? Accuracy-Performance Trade-Offs in LLM Quantization”. Despite the popularity of large language model (LLM) quantization for inference acceleration, significant uncertainty remains regarding the accuracy-performance trade-offs associated with various quantization formats. The study presents a comprehensive empirical study of quantized accuracy, evaluating popular quantization formats (FP8, INT8, INT4) across academic benchmarks and real-world tasks, on the entire Llama-3.1 model family. Additionally, the study examines the difference in text generated by quantized models versus their uncompressed counterparts. Beyond benchmarks, the work also presents a couple of quantization improvements which allowed to obtain state-of-the-art accuracy recovery results. The investigation, encompassing over 500,000 individual evaluations, yields several key findings: (1) FP8 weight and activation quantization (W8A8-FP) is lossless across all model scales, (2) INT8 weight and activation quantization (W8A8-INT), when properly tuned, incurs surprisingly low 1-3% accuracy degradation, and (3) INT4 weight-only quantization (W4A16-INT) is competitive with 8-bit integer weight and activation quantization. To address the question of the "best" format for a given deployment environment, the authors conduct inference performance analysis using the popular open-source vLLM framework on various GPU architectures. The study finds that W4A16 offers the best cost-efficiency for synchronous deployments, and for asynchronous deployment on mid-tier GPUs. At the same time, W8A8 formats excel in asynchronous "continuous batching" deployment of mid- and large-size models on high-end GPUs. The results provide a set of practical guidelines for deploying quantized LLMs across scales and performance requirements. <br> <br>

27. ***AMD launches open-source language models for efficient local use on AMD platforms:  <br>The 1B parameter models, trained on AMD GPUs, excel in reasoning and instruction-following, offering privacy-focused, energy-efficient solutions for specialized applications.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 4, [according to AM Community](https://community.amd.com/t5/ai/introducing-the-first-amd-1b-language-models-amd-olmo/ba-p/721253), AMD released its IB language models. AMD has introduced its first series of fully open 1 billion parameter language models, AMD OLMo, continuing its tradition of open-sourcing models and code. These models are designed to be pre-trained and fine-tuned for domain-specific applications, allowing for better alignment with unique use cases. The AMD OLMo models are pre-trained with 1.3 trillion tokens on AMD Instinct GPUs and include three checkpoints: AMD OLMo 1B, AMD OLMo 1B SFT, and AMD OLMo 1B SFT DPO. These models demonstrate improved performance in reasoning, instruction-following, and chat capabilities compared to other similar-sized open-source models. AMD has also made these models accessible for local use on AMD Ryzen AI PCs, emphasizing privacy, efficiency, and lower power consumption. The initiative aims to empower the community to innovate and advance AI research. <br> <br>

29. ***Duke and Google enhance LLM factual accuracy with Self Logits Evolution Decoding (SLED):  <br>SLED improves output truthfulness by refining logits across model layers, achieving up to 20% better factuality without additional latency and supporting various model types and sizes.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 1, Duke Uni and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02433) “SLED: Self Logits Evolution Decoding for Improving Factuality in Large Language Models”. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their outputs can sometimes be unreliable or factually incorrect. To address this, the study introduces Self Logits Evolution Decoding (SLED), a novel decoding framework that enhances the truthfulness of LLMs without relying on external knowledge bases or requiring further fine-tuning. From an optimization perspective, the SLED framework leverages the latent knowledge embedded within the LLM by contrasting the output logits from the final layer with those from early layers. It then utilizes an approximate gradient approach to enable latent knowledge to guide the self-refinement of outputs, thereby effectively improving factual accuracy. Extensive experiments have been conducted on established benchmarks across a diverse range of model families (LLaMA 2, LLaMA 3, Gemma) and scales (from 2B to 70B), including more advanced architectural configurations such as the mixture of experts (MoE). The evaluation spans a wide variety of tasks, including multi-choice, open-generation, and adaptations to chain-of-thought reasoning tasks. The results demonstrate that SLED consistently improves factual accuracy by up to 20% compared to existing decoding methods while maintaining natural language fluency and negligible latency overhead. Furthermore, it can be flexibly combined with other decoding methods to further enhance their performance. <br> <br>

31. ***Specialized Sparse Autoencoders (SSAEs) for Foundation Models:  <br>To better interpret rare concepts in foundation models, CMU introduced SSAEs, which focus on specific subdomains. These models outperform general-purpose SAEs in capturing subdomain-tail concepts. In a Bias in Bios case study, SSAEs reduced spurious gender information, enhancing classification accuracy by 12.5%.*** <br> <br>
    Nov 1, CMU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00743) “Decoding Dark Matter: Specialized Sparse Autoencoders for Interpreting Rare Concepts in Foundation Models”. Understanding and mitigating the potential risks associated with foundation models (FMs) hinges on developing effective interpretability methods. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for disentangling FM representations, but they struggle to capture rare, yet crucial concepts in the data. The study introduces Specialized Sparse Autoencoders (SSAEs), designed to illuminate these elusive dark matter features by focusing on specific subdomains. The study presents a practical recipe for training SSAEs, demonstrating the efficacy of dense retrieval for data selection and the benefits of Tilted Empirical Risk Minimization as a training objective to improve concept recall. The evaluation of SSAEs on standard metrics, such as downstream perplexity and L_0 sparsity, show that they effectively capture subdomain tail concepts, exceeding the capabilities of general-purpose SAEs. The study showcases the practical utility of SSAEs in a case study on the Bias in Bios dataset, where SSAEs achieve a 12.5% increase in worst-group classification accuracy when applied to remove spurious gender information. SSAEs provide a powerful new lens for peering into the inner workings of FMs in subdomains. <br> <br> 

33. ***DynaMath Benchmark for Mathematical Reasoning in VLMs:  <br>The DynaMath benchmark was introduced to evaluate Vision-Language Models' (VLMs) mathematical reasoning, assessing robustness with question variants. Tests on 14 models revealed lower worst-case versus average-case accuracy, emphasizing the need to strengthen VLMs' reasoning abilities.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 29, UIUC and UC Berkeley published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00836) “DynaMath: A Dynamic Visual Benchmark for Evaluating Mathematical Reasoning Robustness of Vision Language Models”. The rapid advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great potential in tackling mathematical reasoning tasks that involve visual context. Unlike humans who can reliably apply solution steps to similar problems with minor modifications, the study found that SOTA VLMs like GPT-4o can consistently fail in these scenarios, revealing limitations in their mathematical reasoning capabilities. This work investigates the mathematical reasoning robustness in VLMs and evaluate how well these models perform under different variants of the same question, such as changes in visual numerical values or function graphs. While several vision-based math benchmarks have been developed to assess VLMs' problem-solving capabilities, these benchmarks contain only static sets of problems and cannot easily evaluate mathematical reasoning robustness. To fill this gap, the study introduces DynaMath, a dynamic visual math benchmark designed for in-depth assessment of VLMs. DynaMath includes 501 high-quality, multi-topic seed questions, each represented as a Python program. Those programs are carefully designed and annotated to enable the automatic generation of a much larger set of concrete questions, including many different types of visual and textual variations. DynaMath allows to evaluate the generalization ability of VLMs, by assessing their performance under varying input conditions of a seed question. The work evaluated 14 SOTA VLMs with 5,010 generated concrete questions. The results show that the worst-case model accuracy, defined as the percentage of correctly answered seed questions in all 10 variants, is significantly lower than the average-case accuracy. The analysis emphasizes the need to study the robustness of VLMs' reasoning abilities, and DynaMath provides valuable insights to guide the development of more reliable models for mathematical reasoning.

35. ***Cost-Benefit of Semantic Chunking in RAG Systems   <br>This study challenges the efficacy of semantic chunking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems, finding no consistent performance gain over fixed-size chunking, thus questioning its computational cost.*** <br><br>
    Oct 16, Vectara Inc and Uni of Wisconsin-Madison published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13070) “Is Semantic Chunking Worth the Computational Cost?”. Recent advances in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have popularized semantic chunking, which aims to improve retrieval performance by dividing documents into semantically coherent segments. Despite its growing adoption, the actual benefits over simpler fixed-size chunking, where documents are split into consecutive, fixed-size segments, remain unclear. This study systematically evaluates the effectiveness of semantic chunking using three common retrieval-related tasks: document retrieval, evidence retrieval, and retrieval-based answer generation. The results show that the computational costs associated with semantic chunking are not justified by consistent performance gains. These findings challenge the previous assumptions about semantic chunking and highlight the need for more efficient chunking strategies in RAG systems. <br> <br>

37. ***Numerical Representation in Language Models:  <br>Research found LLMs use a digit-wise representation in base 10, which contributes to their numerical errors. This representation explains LLM inaccuracies in basic numerical reasoning and highlights the need for alternative approaches in numerical tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 15, Uni of Oxford and Tel Aviv Uni published [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11781) “Language Models Encode Numbers Using Digit Representations in Base 10”. Large language models (LLMs) frequently make errors when handling even simple numerical problems, such as comparing two small numbers. A natural hypothesis is that these errors stem from how LLMs represent numbers, and specifically, whether their representations of numbers capture their numeric values. The work tackles this question from the observation that LLM errors on numerical tasks are often distributed across the digits of the answer rather than normally around its numeric value. Through a series of probing experiments and causal interventions, the study shows that LLMs internally represent numbers with individual circular representations per-digit in base 10. This digit-wise representation, as opposed to a value representation, sheds light on the error patterns of models on tasks involving numerical reasoning and could serve as a basis for future studies on analyzing numerical mechanisms in LLMs. <br> <br>

39. ***Loss of Plasticity in Deep Continual Learning:  <br>The study showed that standard deep learning methods lose plasticity in continual learning tasks. Only algorithms with diversity mechanisms, such as continual backpropagation, maintained indefinite plasticity, suggesting that non-gradient elements are essential for sustained learning.*** <br> <br>
    Aug 21, Nature published a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07711-7) from Alberta Uni “Loss of plasticity in deep continual learning”. Artificial neural networks, deep-learning methods and the backpropagation algorithm1 form the foundation of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. These methods are almost always used in two phases, one in which the weights of the network are updated and one in which the weights are held constant while the network is used or evaluated. This contrasts with natural learning and many applications, which require continual learning. It has been unclear whether or not deep learning methods work in continual learning settings. Here the study shows that they do not—that standard deep-learning methods gradually lose plasticity in continual-learning settings until they learn no better than a shallow network. The study shows such loss of plasticity using the classic ImageNet dataset and reinforcement-learning problems across a wide range of variations in the network and the learning algorithm. Plasticity is maintained indefinitely only by algorithms that continually inject diversity into the network, such as the continual backpropagation algorithm, a variation of backpropagation in which a small fraction of less-used units are continually and randomly reinitialized. The results indicate that methods based on gradient descent are not enough—that sustained deep learning requires a random, non-gradient component to maintain variability and plasticity. <br> <br>

41. ***Evaluating Implicit World Models in Generative Models:  <br>This study introduced evaluation metrics for assessing generative models' implicit world models in deterministic domains like game-playing and navigation. Findings revealed that despite good performance on diagnostics, models' world representations were incoherent, highlighting fragility in real-world applications.*** <br> <br>
    Jun 22, Harvard Uni, MIT, Cornell Uni and Uni of Chicago Booth published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.03689) “Evaluating the World Model Implicit in a Generative Model”. Recent work suggests that large language models may implicitly learn world models. How should people assess this possibility? The study formalizes this question for the case where the underlying reality is governed by a deterministic finite automaton. This includes problems as diverse as simple logical reasoning, geographic navigation, game-playing, and chemistry. The study proposes new evaluation metrics for world model recovery inspired by the classic Myhill-Nerode theorem from language theory. The authors illustrate their utility in three domains: game playing, logic puzzles, and navigation. In all domains, the generative models considered do well on existing diagnostics for assessing world models, but the evaluation metrics reveal their world models to be far less coherent than they appear. Such incoherence creates fragility: using a generative model to solve related but subtly different tasks can lead it to fail badly. Building generative models that meaningfully capture the underlying logic of the domains they model would be immensely valuable; the results suggest new ways to assess how close a given model is to that goal.

1. ***AI Identifies Database Vulnerability:  <br>Google’s AI project, “Big Sleep,” discovered a previously unknown bug in SQLite, showcasing the ability of AI agents to find software vulnerabilities. This achievement emphasizes the potential of large language models in improving software security.*** <br> <br>
   Nov 2, [according to PCMag](https://au.pcmag.com/ai/108079/googles-big-sleep-ai-project-uncovers-real-software-vulnerabilities), Google’s AI project, “Big Sleep,” recently discovered a previously unknown and exploitable bug in SQLite, an open-source database engine. This marks the first public instance of an AI agent identifying a new memory-safety issue in widely used software. The AI’s success highlights the potential of large language models in finding software vulnerabilities, offering a significant advantage in defending against hackers. Designed to mimic human security researchers, Big Sleep was able to perform a root-cause analysis by triggering and investigating the bug. This achievement suggests that AI can enhance vulnerability research, making it more efficient and effective. <br> <br>

3. ***Benchmarking Code Generation:  <br>Purdue University introduced REPOCOD, a new code generation benchmark that highlights the limitations of existing large language models (LLMs) in real-world software development. Evaluations showed no model exceeded 30% accuracy on this challenging benchmark, indicating the need for more advanced LLMs.*** <br> <br>
   Oct 31, Purdue Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21647) “Can Language Models Replace Programmers? REPOCOD Says 'Not Yet'”. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in code generation with more than 90 pass@1 in solving Python coding problems in HumanEval and MBPP. Such high accuracy leads to the question: can LLMs replace human programmers? Existing manual crafted, simple, or single-line code generation benchmarks cannot answer this question due to their gap with real-world software development. To answer this question, the study proposes REPOCOD, a code generation benchmark with 980 problems collected from 11 popular real-world projects, with more than 58% of them requiring file-level or repository-level context information. In addition, REPOCOD has the longest average canonical solution length (331.6 tokens) and the highest average cyclomatic complexity (9.00) compared to existing benchmarks. In the evaluations on ten LLMs, none of the models can achieve more than 30 pass@1 on REPOCOD, disclosing the necessity of building stronger LLMs that can help developers in real-world software development. <br> <br>

5. ***Layer Gradients in LLMs:  <br>A study from the University of Maryland explored how fast and slow thinking affects gradient patterns in LLMs during training. It found that slow thinking methods result in greater stability and better discrimination of correct reasoning paths, enhancing our understanding of LLM training efficiency.*** <br> <br>
   Oct 31, Uni of Maryland published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23743) “What Happened in LLMs Layers when Trained for Fast vs. Slow Thinking: A Gradient Perspective”. What makes a difference in the post-training of LLMs? The work investigates the training patterns of different layers in large language models (LLMs), through the lens of gradient, when training with different responses and initial models. The authors are specifically interested in how fast vs. slow thinking affects the layer-wise gradients, given the recent popularity of training LLMs on reasoning paths such as chain-of-thoughts (CoT) and process rewards. In this study, fast thinking without CoT leads to larger gradients and larger differences of gradients across layers than slow thinking (Detailed CoT), indicating the learning stability brought by the latter. Moreover, pre-trained LLMs are less affected by the instability of fast thinking than instruction-tuned LLMs. Additionally, the authors study whether the gradient patterns can reflect the correctness of responses when training different LLMs using slow vs. fast thinking paths. The results show that the gradients of slow thinking can distinguish correct and irrelevant reasoning paths. As a comparison, the work conducts similar gradient analyses on non-reasoning knowledge learning tasks, on which, however, trivially increasing the response length does not lead to similar behaviors of slow thinking. The study strengthens fundamental understandings of LLM training and sheds novel insights on its efficiency and stability, which pave the way towards building a generalizable System-2 agent.

9. ***Evaluating Factual Knowledge:  <br>OpenAI’s new benchmark, SimpleQA, assesses LLMs' abilities to answer short factual questions accurately. Designed to challenge models like GPT-4, SimpleQA offers a straightforward grading system, with the best-performing model achieving a score of 42.4.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 30, OpenAI published a [paper](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/simpleqa.pdf) “Measuring short-form factuality in large language models”. The work presents SimpleQA, a benchmark that evaluates the ability of language models to answer short, fact-seeking questions. The study prioritized two properties in designing this eval. First, SimpleQA is challenging, as it is adversarially collected against GPT-4 responses. Second, responses are easy to grade, because questions are created such that there exists only a single, indisputable answer. Each answer in SimpleQA is graded as either correct, incorrect, or not attempted. A model with ideal behavior would get as many questions correct as possible while not attempting the questions for which it is not confident it knows the correct answer. SimpleQA is a simple, targeted evaluation for whether models “know what they know,” and the authors hope is that this benchmark will remain relevant for the next few generations of frontier models. According to this test, the highest score of AI models is 42.4.  SimpleQA can be found at https://github.com/openai/simple-evals. <br> <br>

11. ***Memorization vs. Reasoning in LLMs:  <br>A study from multiple institutions investigated the role of memorization in LLMs' logical reasoning capabilities. Results indicated that while LLMs perform well on familiar puzzles, they often fail on modified versions, highlighting the balance between memorization and genuine reasoning skills.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 30, Google, UIUC, Princeton Uni, and Allen Inst for AI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23123) “On Memorization of Large Language Models in Logical Reasoning”. Large language models (LLMs) achieve good performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks, yet could also make basic reasoning mistakes. This contrasting behavior is puzzling when it comes to understanding the mechanisms behind LLMs' reasoning capabilities. One hypothesis is that the increasingly high and nearly saturated performance on common reasoning benchmarks could be due to the memorization of similar problems. This study systematically investigates this hypothesis with a quantitative measurement of memorization in reasoning tasks, using a dynamically generated logical reasoning benchmark based on Knights and Knaves (K&K) puzzles. The study found that LLMs could interpolate the training puzzles (achieving near-perfect accuracy) after fine-tuning, yet fail when those puzzles are slightly perturbed, suggesting that the models heavily rely on memorization to solve those training puzzles. On the other hand, the study shows that while fine-tuning leads to heavy memorization, it also consistently improves generalization performance. In-depth analyses with perturbation tests, cross difficulty-level transferability, probing model internals, and fine-tuning with wrong answers suggest that the LLMs learn to reason on K&K puzzles despite training data memorization. This phenomenon indicates that LLMs exhibit a complex interplay between memorization and genuine reasoning abilities. Finally, analysis with per-sample memorization score sheds light on how LLMs switch between reasoning and memorization in solving logical puzzles.

13. ***Scaling Transformers Efficiently:  <br>The introduction of TokenFormer proposes a scalable architecture for transformers that allows for efficient model parameter sharing without retraining. This approach reduces computational costs while maintaining performance comparable to traditional transformer models.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 30, MPII, Google and Peking Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23168) “TokenFormer: Rethinking Transformer Scaling with Tokenized Model Parameters”. Transformers have become the predominant architecture in foundation models due to their excellent performance across various domains. However, the substantial cost of scaling these models remains a significant concern. This problem arises primarily from their dependence on a fixed number of parameters within linear projections. When architectural modifications (e.g., channel dimensions) are introduced, the entire model typically requires retraining from scratch. As model sizes continue growing, this strategy results in increasingly high computational costs and becomes unsustainable. To overcome this problem, we introduce TokenFormer, a natively scalable architecture that leverages the attention mechanism not only for computations among input tokens but also for interactions between tokens and model parameters, thereby enhancing architectural flexibility. By treating model parameters as tokens, we replace all the linear projections in Transformers with our token-parameter attention layer, where input tokens act as queries and model parameters as keys and values. This reformulation allows for progressive and efficient scaling without necessitating retraining from scratch. Our model scales from 124M to 1.4B parameters by incrementally adding new key-value parameter pairs, achieving performance comparable to Transformers trained from scratch while greatly reducing training costs. Code and models are available at https://github.com/Haiyang-W/TokenFormer. <br> <br>

15. ***LLMs in Data Science:  <br>A benchmark developed by Snowflake and the Polish Academy of Sciences assesses LLMs in generating feature engineering code. The study demonstrates that LLMs can effectively transform datasets, providing a cost-effective method for evaluating their capabilities.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 30, Snowflake and Polish Academy Sciences published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23331) “Can Models Help Us Create Better Models? Evaluating LLMs as Data Scientists”. The study presents a benchmark for large language models designed to tackle one of the most knowledge-intensive tasks in data science: writing feature engineering code, which requires domain knowledge in addition to a deep understanding of the underlying problem and data structure. The model is provided with a dataset description in a prompt and asked to generate code transforming it. The evaluation score is derived from the improvement achieved by an XGBoost model fit on the modified dataset compared to the original data. By an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models and comparison to well-established benchmarks, the study demonstrates that the FeatEng of the proposal can cheaply and efficiently assess the broad capabilities of LLMs, in contrast to the existing methods. <br> <br>

17. ***AI in Research Support:  <br>The AAAR-1.0 benchmark, introduced by researchers from various institutions, evaluates LLMs' performance in complex research tasks. This new dataset aims to assess LLMs' capabilities in conducting specialized research activities, highlighting their potential and limitations.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 29, Pennsylvania State Uni, Netflix, Uni of California Davis, Uni of Illinois Chicago et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22394) “AAAR-1.0: Assessing AI's Potential to Assist Research”. Numerous studies have assessed the proficiency of AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), in facilitating everyday tasks such as email writing, question answering, and creative content generation. However, researchers face unique challenges and opportunities in leveraging LLMs for their own work, such as brainstorming research ideas, designing experiments, and writing or reviewing papers. This study introduces AAAR-1.0, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate LLM performance in three fundamental, expertise-intensive research tasks: (i) EquationInference, assessing the correctness of equations based on the contextual information in paper submissions; (ii) ExperimentDesign, designing experiments to validate research ideas and solutions; (iii) PaperWeakness, identifying weaknesses in paper submissions; and (iv) REVIEWCRITIQUE, identifying each segment in human reviews is deficient or not. AAAR-1.0 differs from prior benchmarks in two key ways: first, it is explicitly research-oriented, with tasks requiring deep domain expertise; second, it is researcher-oriented, mirroring the primary activities that researchers engage in on a daily basis. An evaluation of both open-source and proprietary LLMs reveals their potential as well as limitations in conducting sophisticated research tasks. The authors will keep iterating AAAR-1.0 to new versions. <br> <br>

19. ***Innovations in Parameter Sharing:  <br>The study on Relaxed Recursive Transformers presents a novel approach to parameter sharing in LLMs, enabling efficient model size reduction without sacrificing performance. This method improves inference speed while maintaining model effectiveness.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 28, KAIST and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.20672) “Relaxed Recursive Transformers: Effective Parameter Sharing with Layer-wise LoRA”. Large language models (LLMs) are expensive to deploy. Parameter sharing offers a possible path towards reducing their size and cost, but its effectiveness in modern LLMs remains fairly limited. This work revisits "layer tying" as form of parameter sharing in Transformers, and introduce novel methods for converting existing LLMs into smaller "Recursive Transformers" that share parameters across layers, with minimal loss of performance. Here, the Recursive Transformers are efficiently initialized from standard pretrained Transformers, but only use a single block of unique layers that is then repeated multiple times in a loop. The work further improves performance by introducing Relaxed Recursive Transformers that add flexibility to the layer tying constraint via depth-wise low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules, yet still preserve the compactness of the overall model. The work shows that the recursive models (e.g., recursive Gemma 1B) outperform both similar-sized vanilla pretrained models (such as TinyLlama 1.1B and Pythia 1B) and knowledge distillation baselines -- and can even recover most of the performance of the original "full-size" model (e.g., Gemma 2B with no shared parameters). Finally, we propose Continuous Depth-wise Batching, a promising new inference paradigm enabled by the Recursive Transformer when paired with early exiting. In a theoretical analysis, the work shows that this has the potential to lead to significant (2-3x) gains in inference throughput. <br> <br>

21. ***Compression Error Compensation:  <br>Nvidia's research introduces EoRA, a training-free method for compensating errors in compressed LLMs. This approach optimizes performance without requiring extensive retraining, demonstrating significant improvements in various tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 28, Nvidia published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21271) “EoRA: Training-free Compensation for Compressed LLM with Eigenspace Low-Rank Approximation”. This study re-formulates the model compression problem into the customized compensation problem: Given a compressed model, the study aims to introduce residual low-rank paths to compensate for compression errors under customized requirements from users (e.g., tasks, compression ratios), resulting in greater flexibility in adjusting overall capacity without being constrained by specific compression formats. However, naively applying SVD to derive residual paths causes suboptimal utilization of the low-rank representation capacity. Instead, the work proposes Training-free Eigenspace Low-Rank Approximation (EoRA), a method that directly minimizes compression-induced errors without requiring gradient-based training, achieving fast optimization in minutes using a small amount of calibration data. EoRA projects compression errors into the eigenspace of input activations, leveraging eigenvalues to effectively prioritize the reconstruction of high-importance error components. Moreover, EoRA can be seamlessly integrated with fine-tuning and quantization to further improve effectiveness and efficiency. EoRA consistently outperforms previous methods in compensating errors for compressed LLaMA2/3 models on various tasks, such as language generation, commonsense reasoning, and math reasoning tasks (e.g., 31.31%/12.88% and 9.69% improvements on ARC-Easy/ARC-Challenge and MathQA when compensating LLaMA3-8B that is quantized to 4-bit and pruned to 2:4 sparsity). EoRA offers a scalable, training-free solution to compensate for compression errors, making it a powerful tool to deploy LLMs in various capacity and efficiency requirements. <br> <br>

23. ***Modular Framework for Social Reasoning:  <br>The SocialGPT framework combines vision and language models for social relation reasoning. It achieves competitive performance without additional training and offers interpretable results, enhancing understanding of image content.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 28, Harvard Uni, IBM et al. published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21411) “SocialGPT: Prompting LLMs for Social Relation Reasoning via Greedy Segment Optimization”. Social relation reasoning aims to identify relation categories such as friends, spouses, and colleagues from images. While current methods adopt the paradigm of training a dedicated network end-to-end using labeled image data, they are limited in terms of generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, the study first presents a simple yet well-crafted framework named SocialGPT, which combines the perception capability of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) within a modular framework, providing a strong baseline for social relation recognition. Specifically, the study instructs VFMs to translate image content into a textual social story, and then utilize LLMs for text-based reasoning. SocialGPT introduces systematic design principles to adapt VFMs and LLMs separately and bridge their gaps. Without additional model training, it achieves competitive zero-shot results on two databases while offering interpretable answers, as LLMs can generate language-based explanations for the decisions. The manual prompt design process for LLMs at the reasoning phase is tedious and an automated prompt optimization method is desired. As the work essentially converts a visual classification task into a generative task of LLMs, automatic prompt optimization encounters a unique long prompt optimization issue. To address this issue, the study further proposes the Greedy Segment Prompt Optimization (GSPO), which performs a greedy search by utilizing gradient information at the segment level. Experimental results show that GSPO significantly improves performance, and the method also generalizes to different image styles. The code is available at https://github.com/Mengzibin/SocialGPT. <br> <br>

25. ***Relevance Feedback in Retrieval:  <br>MIT's study presents ReDE-RF, a method for improving zero-shot dense retrieval by focusing on relevance estimation rather than hypothetical document generation. This approach enhances efficiency and accuracy in document retrieval tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 28, MIT published [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21242) “Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval with Embeddings from Relevance Feedback”. Building effective dense retrieval systems remains difficult when relevance supervision is not available. Recent work has looked to overcome this challenge by using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate hypothetical documents that can be used to find the closest real document. However, this approach relies solely on the LLM to have domain-specific knowledge relevant to the query, which may not be practical. Furthermore, generating hypothetical documents can be inefficient as it requires the LLM to generate a large number of tokens for each query. To address these challenges, the work introduces Real Document Embeddings from Relevance Feedback (ReDE-RF). Inspired by relevance feedback, ReDE-RF proposes to re-frame hypothetical document generation as a relevance estimation task, using an LLM to select which documents should be used for nearest neighbor search. Through this re-framing, the LLM no longer needs domain-specific knowledge but only needs to judge what is relevant. Additionally, relevance estimation only requires the LLM to output a single token, thereby improving search latency. Experiments show that ReDE-RF consistently surpasses state-of-the-art zero-shot dense retrieval methods across a wide range of low-resource retrieval datasets while also making significant improvements in latency per-query. <br> <br>

27. ***Fine-Tuning Analysis:  <br>A study contrasts Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and full fine-tuning in LLMs, revealing that while they may perform similarly, they access different parts of parameter space. This difference impacts generalization and adaptability in various tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 28, MIT published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21228) “LoRA vs Full Fine-tuning: An Illusion of Equivalence”. Fine-tuning is a crucial paradigm for adapting pre-trained large language models to downstream tasks. Recently, methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been shown to match the performance of fully fine-tuned models on various tasks with an extreme reduction in the number of trainable parameters. Even in settings where both methods learn similarly accurate models, are their learned solutions really equivalent? The work studies how different fine-tuning methods change pre-trained models by analyzing the model's weight matrices through the lens of their spectral properties. The work finds that full fine-tuning and LoRA yield weight matrices whose singular value decompositions exhibit very different structure; moreover, the fine-tuned models themselves show distinct generalization behaviors when tested outside the adaptation task's distribution. More specifically, the study first shows that the weight matrices trained with LoRA have new, high-ranking singular vectors, which is called intruder dimensions. Intruder dimensions do not appear during full fine-tuning. Second, the work shows that LoRA models with intruder dimensions, despite achieving similar performance to full fine-tuning on the target task, become worse models of the pre-training distribution and adapt less robustly to multiple tasks sequentially. Higher-rank, rank-stabilized LoRA models closely mirror full fine-tuning, even when performing on par with lower-rank LoRA models on the same tasks. These results suggest that models updated with LoRA and full fine-tuning access different parts of parameter space, even when they perform equally on the fine-tuned distribution. The study concludes by examining why intruder dimensions appear in LoRA fine-tuned models, why they are undesirable, and how their effects can be minimized. <br> <br>

29. ***Iterative Context Retrieval:  <br>The FACT method introduces an iterative approach to improve multi-fact retrieval in LLMs, addressing the challenges of losing critical information. This technique significantly enhances performance in multi-fact tasks, highlighting the need for better retrieval strategies.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 28, DeepWisdom, Uni de Montreal & Mila and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21012) “FACT: Examining the Effectiveness of Iterative Context Rewriting for Multi-fact Retrieval”. Large Language Models (LLMs) are proficient at retrieving single facts from extended contexts, yet they struggle with tasks requiring the simultaneous retrieval of multiple facts, especially during generation. This paper identifies a novel "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon, where LLMs progressively lose track of critical information throughout the generation process, resulting in incomplete or inaccurate retrieval. To address this challenge, the study introduces Find All Crucial Texts (FACT), an iterative retrieval method that refines context through successive rounds of rewriting. This approach enables models to capture essential facts incrementally, which are often overlooked in single-pass retrieval. Experiments demonstrate that FACT substantially enhances multi-fact retrieval performance across various tasks, though improvements are less notable in general-purpose QA scenarios. The findings shed light on the limitations of LLMs in multi-fact retrieval and underscore the need for more resilient long-context retrieval strategies. <br> <br>

31. ***Relaxed Recursive Transformers:  <br>This paper introduces a method for parameter sharing in large language models (LLMs) through Recursive Transformers, which reuse layers to reduce size without significant performance loss. The approach, enhanced by Relaxed Recursive Transformers using LoRA modules, achieves better performance than traditional models and proposes a new inference method that could improve throughput significantly.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 28, KAIST AI and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.20672) “Relaxed Recursive Transformers: Effective Parameter Sharing with Layer-wise LoRA”. Large language models (LLMs) are expensive to deploy. Parameter sharing offers a possible path towards reducing their size and cost, but its effectiveness in modern LLMs remains fairly limited.

33. ***Beyond Autoregression:  <br>This research explores diffusion language models that can generate multiple tokens simultaneously, outperforming autoregressive models in quality and speed. A novel distillation method reduces inference steps drastically, leading to faster generation rates.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 28, EPFL published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21035) “Beyond Autoregression: Fast LLMs via Self-Distillation Through Time”. Autoregressive (AR) Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success across numerous tasks. However, the AR modeling paradigm presents certain limitations; for instance, contemporary autoregressive LLMs are trained to generate one token at a time, which can result in noticeable latency. Recent advances have indicated that search and repeated sampling can enhance performance in various applications, such as theorem proving, code generation, and alignment, by utilizing greater computational resources during inference. This paper demonstrates that diffusion language models are capable of generating at least 32 tokens simultaneously, while exceeding the performance of AR models in text quality and on the LAMBADA natural language understanding benchmark. This outcome is achieved through a novel distillation method for discrete diffusion models, which reduces the number of inference steps by a factor of 32-64. Practically, the models, even without caching, can generate tokens at a rate that is up to 8 times faster than AR models employing KV caching, and it is anticipated further improvements with the inclusion of caching. Moreover, the paper demonstrates the efficacy of the approach for diffusion language models with up to 860M parameters. <br> <br>

35. ***Chain-of-Thought Prompting:  <br>Investigating when chain-of-thought prompting can harm model performance, this study identifies tasks where reasoning can lead to poorer outcomes, drawing parallels with human cognition. It shows significant drops in performance on specific tasks when using CoT.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 27, Princeton Uni and NYU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21333) “Mind Your Step (by Step): Chain-of-Thought can Reduce Performance on Tasks where Thinking Makes Humans Worse”. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has become a widely used strategy for working with large language and multimodal models. While CoT has been shown to improve performance across many tasks, determining the settings in which it is effective remains an ongoing effort. In particular, it is still an open question in what settings CoT systematically reduces model performance. This study seeks to identify the characteristics of tasks where CoT reduces performance by drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, looking at cases where (i) verbal thinking or deliberation hurts performance in humans, and (ii) the constraints governing human performance generalize to language models. Three such cases are implicit statistical learning, visual recognition, and classifying with patterns containing exceptions. In extensive experiments across all three settings, the study finds that a diverse collection of state-of-the-art models exhibit significant drop-offs in performance (e.g., up to 36.3% absolute accuracy for OpenAI o1-preview compared to GPT-4o) when using inference-time reasoning compared to zero-shot counterparts. The work also identifies three tasks that satisfy condition (i) but not (ii), and find that while verbal thinking reduces human performance in these tasks, CoT retains or increases model performance. Overall, the results show that while there is not an exact parallel between the cognitive processes of models and those of humans, considering cases where thinking has negative consequences for human performance can help to identify settings where it negatively impacts models. By connecting the literature on human deliberation with evaluations of CoT, the work offers a new tool that can be used in understanding the impact of prompt choices and inference-time reasoning. <br> <br>

37. ***Centaur: A Unified Model of Cognition:  <br>The Centaur model aims to simulate human cognition through extensive behavioral data. It shows promise in predicting human responses across diverse experimental settings, potentially transforming cognitive science.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 26, Helmholtz Munich, Uni of Tuebingen, Uni of Oxford, NYU, MPI, Google, Princeton Uni, Uni of Cambridge et al published 140-page [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.20268) “Centaur: a foundation model of human cognition”. Establishing a unified theory of cognition has been a major goal of psychology. While there have been previous attempts to instantiate such theories by building computational models, we currently do not have one model that captures the human mind in its entirety. Here the study introduces Centaur, a computational model that can predict and simulate human behavior in any experiment expressible in natural language. The study derived Centaur by finetuning a state-of-the-art language model on a novel, large-scale data set called Psych-101. Psych-101 reaches an unprecedented scale, covering trial-by-trial data from over 60,000 participants performing over 10,000,000 choices in 160 experiments. Centaur not only captures the behavior of held-out participants better than existing cognitive models, but also generalizes to new cover stories, structural task modifications, and entirely new domains. Furthermore, the study finds that the model's internal representations become more aligned with human neural activity after finetuning. Taken together, Centaur is the first real candidate for a unified model of human cognition. The authors anticipate that it will have a disruptive impact on the cognitive sciences, challenging the existing paradigm for developing computational models. <br> <br>

39. ***Fast Best-of-N Decoding:  <br>This paper presents Speculative Rejection, a method for efficient inference-time alignment of LLMs, achieving the effectiveness of Best-of-N alignment with significantly lower computational costs.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 26, CMU, Uni of Virginia, UC Berkeley, Princeton, Fudan Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.20290) “Fast Best-of-N Decoding via Speculative Rejection”. The safe and effective deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) involves a critical step called alignment, which ensures that the model's responses are in accordance with human preferences. Prevalent alignment techniques, such as DPO, PPO and their variants, align LLMs by changing the pre-trained model weights during a phase called post-training. While predominant, these post-training methods add substantial complexity before LLMs can be deployed. Inference-time alignment methods avoid the complex post-training step and instead bias the generation towards responses that are aligned with human preferences. The best-known inference-time alignment method, called Best-of-N, is as effective as the state-of-the-art post-training procedures. Unfortunately, Best-of-N requires vastly more resources at inference time than standard decoding strategies, which makes it computationally not viable. This study introduces Speculative Rejection, a computationally-viable inference-time alignment algorithm. It generates high-scoring responses according to a given reward model, like Best-of-N does, while being between 16 to 32 times more computationally efficient. <br> <br>

41. ***RARe: Retrieval Augmented Retrieval:  <br>RARe demonstrates how in-context examples can improve retrieval model performance by finetuning models on similar query pairs, leading to enhanced generalization and retrieval accuracy.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 26, Uni of Texas at Austin et al. published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.20088) “RARe: Retrieval Augmented Retrieval with In-Context Examples”. The work investigates whether in-context examples, widely used in decoder-only language models (LLMs), can improve embedding model performance in retrieval tasks. Unlike in LLMs, naively prepending in-context examples (query-document pairs) to the target query at inference time does not work out of the box. The study introduces a simple approach to enable retrievers to use in-context examples. The approach, RARe, finetunes a pre-trained model with in-context examples whose query is semantically similar to the target query. This can be applied to adapt various base architectures (i.e., decoder-only language models, retriever models) and consistently achieves performance gains of up to +2.72% nDCG across various open-domain retrieval datasets (BeIR, RAR-b). In particular, the study finds RARe exhibits stronger out-of-domain generalization compared to models using queries without in-context examples, similar to what is seen for in-context learning in LLMs. The study further provides analysis on the design choices of in-context example augmentation and lay the foundation for future work in this space. <br> <br>

43. ***Rethinking Uncertainty:  <br>This review proposes a comprehensive framework for understanding and measuring uncertainty in LLMs, aiming to improve reliability in mission-critical applications.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 26, Virginia Tech, UIUC, The Uni of Texas at Dallas and Uni of California Davis published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.20199) “Rethinking the Uncertainty: A Critical Review and Analysis in the Era of Large Language Models”. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become fundamental to a broad spectrum of artificial intelligence applications. As the use of LLMs expands, precisely estimating the uncertainty in their predictions has become crucial. Current methods often struggle to accurately identify, measure, and address the true uncertainty, with many focusing primarily on estimating model confidence. This discrepancy is largely due to an incomplete understanding of where, when, and how uncertainties are injected into models. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework specifically designed to identify and understand the types and sources of uncertainty, aligned with the unique characteristics of LLMs. The proposed framework enhances the understanding of the diverse landscape of uncertainties by systematically categorizing and defining each type, establishing a solid foundation for developing targeted methods that can precisely quantify these uncertainties. The study also provides a detailed introduction to key related concepts and examine the limitations of current methods in mission-critical and safety-sensitive applications. The paper concludes with a perspective on future directions aimed at enhancing the reliability and practical adoption of these methods in real-world scenarios. <br> <br>

45. ***Model Equality Testing:  <br>The study formalizes methods for detecting changes in model behavior from APIs, showing how statistical tests can identify whether models serve altered outputs compared to their original versions.*** <br>v
    Oct 26, Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.20247) “Model Equality Testing: Which Model Is This API Serving?”. Users often interact with large language models through black-box inference APIs, both for closed- and open-weight models (e.g., Llama models are popularly accessed via Amazon Bedrock and Azure AI Studio). In order to cut costs or add functionality, API providers may quantize, watermark, or finetune the underlying model, changing the output distribution -- often without notifying users. The study formalizes detecting such distortions as Model Equality Testing, a two-sample testing problem, where the user collects samples from the API and a reference distribution and conducts a statistical test to see if the two distributions are the same. The study finds that tests based on the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between distributions are powerful for this task: a test built on a simple string kernel achieves a median of 77.4% power against a range of distortions, using an average of just 10 samples per prompt. The authors then apply this test to commercial inference APIs for four Llama models, finding that 11 out of 31 endpoints serve different distributions than reference weights released by Meta. <br> <br>

47. ***Measuring Memorization in LLMs:  <br>This research introduces a probabilistic method for assessing LLM memorization rates, providing a clearer understanding of how different sampling techniques influence data extraction capabilities.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 25, Google and Boston Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.19482) “Measuring memorization through probabilistic discoverable extraction”. Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to memorizing training data, raising concerns due to the potential extraction of sensitive information. Current methods to measure memorization rates of LLMs, primarily discoverable extraction (Carlini et al., 2022), rely on single-sequence greedy sampling, potentially underestimating the true extent of memorization. This paper introduces a probabilistic relaxation of discoverable extraction that quantifies the probability of extracting a target sequence within a set of generated samples, considering various sampling schemes and multiple attempts. This approach addresses the limitations of reporting memorization rates through discoverable extraction by accounting for the probabilistic nature of LLMs and user interaction patterns. Experiments demonstrate that this probabilistic measure can reveal cases of higher memorization rates compared to rates found through discoverable extraction. The work further investigates the impact of different sampling schemes on extractability, providing a more comprehensive and realistic assessment of LLM memorization and its associated risks. The contributions include a new probabilistic memorization definition, empirical evidence of its effectiveness, and a thorough evaluation across different models, sizes, sampling schemes, and training data repetitions.  <br> <br>

    Oct 25, OpenAI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21276) “GPT-4o System Card”. GPT-4o is an autoregressive omni model that accepts as input any combination of text, audio, image, and video, and generates any combination of text, audio, and image outputs. It's trained end-to-end across text, vision, and audio, meaning all inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network. GPT-4o can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds, which is similar to human response time in conversation. It matches GPT-4 Turbo performance on text in English and code, with significant improvement on text in non-English languages, while also being much faster and 50% cheaper in the API. GPT-4o is especially better at vision and audio understanding compared to existing models. In line with the commitment to building AI safely and consistent with the voluntary commitments to the White House, OpenAI is sharing the GPT-4o System Card, which includes the Preparedness Framework evaluations. This System Card provides a detailed look at GPT-4o's capabilities, limitations, and safety evaluations across multiple categories, focusing on speech-to-speech while also evaluating text and image capabilities, and measures implemented to ensure the model is safe and aligned. The paper also includes third-party assessments on dangerous capabilities, as well as discussion of potential societal impacts of GPT-4o's text and vision capabilities. <br> <br>

51. ***COAT: Memory-Efficient FP8 Training:  <br>COAT introduces a method to reduce memory usage in FP8 training by optimizing optimizer states and activations, achieving significant training speedups while maintaining performance.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 25, UC Berkeley, Nvidia, MIT and Tsinghua Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.19313) “COAT: Compressing Optimizer states and Activation for Memory-Efficient FP8 Training”. FP8 training has emerged as a promising method for improving training efficiency. Existing frameworks accelerate training by applying FP8 computation to linear layers while leaving optimizer states and activations in higher precision, which fails to fully optimize memory usage. This paper introduces COAT (Compressing Optimizer States and Activations for FP8 Training), a novel FP8 training framework designed to significantly reduce memory footprint when training large models. COAT addresses current limitations through two key innovations: (1) Dynamic Range Expansion, which aligns optimizer state distributions more closely with the FP8 representation range, thereby reducing quantization error, and (2) Mixed-Granularity Activation Quantization, which optimizes activation memory using a combination of per-tensor and per-group quantization strategies. Experiments demonstrate that COAT effectively reduces end-to-end training memory footprint by 1.54x compared to BF16 while achieving nearly lossless performance across various tasks, such as Large Language Model pretraining and fine-tuning and Vision Language Model training. COAT also achieves a 1.43x end-to-end training speedup compared to BF16, performing on par with or surpassing TransformerEngine's speedup. COAT enables efficient full-parameter training of large models on fewer GPUs, and facilitates doubling the batch size in distributed training settings, providing a practical solution for scaling large-scale model training.

53. ***Mixture of Parrots:  <br>This study analyzes the trade-offs in MoE architectures, finding that while they excel at memorization, their reasoning capabilities may not scale similarly.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 24, Harvad Uni, MIT and Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.19034) “Mixture of Parrots: Experts improve memorization more than reasoning”. The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture enables a significant increase in the total number of model parameters with minimal computational overhead. However, it is not clear what performance tradeoffs, if any, exist between MoEs and standard dense transformers. This study shows that as increasing the number of experts (while fixing the number of active parameters), the memorization performance consistently increases while the reasoning capabilities saturate. The study begins by analyzing the theoretical limitations of MoEs at reasoning. The study proves that there exist graph problems that cannot be solved by any number of experts of a certain width; however, the same task can be easily solved by a dense model with a slightly larger width. On the other hand, the study finds that on memory-intensive tasks, MoEs can effectively leverage a small number of active parameters with a large number of experts to memorize the data. The study empirically validates these findings on synthetic graph problems and memory-intensive closed book retrieval tasks. Lastly, the study pre-trains a series of MoEs and dense transformers and evaluate them on commonly used benchmarks in math and natural language. The authors find that increasing the number of experts helps solve knowledge-intensive tasks, but fails to yield the same benefits for reasoning tasks. <br> <br>

55. ***Detecting Label Errors in Datasets:  <br>The paper demonstrates how LLMs can detect label errors in training datasets, suggesting that many perceived model failures may stem from mislabeled data.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 24, Technion Inst of Tech and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18889) “Are LLMs Better than Reported? Detecting Label Errors and Mitigating Their Effect on Model Performance”. NLP benchmarks rely on standardized datasets for training and evaluating models and are crucial for advancing the field. Traditionally, expert annotations ensure high-quality labels; however, the cost of expert annotation does not scale well with the growing demand for larger datasets required by modern models. While crowd-sourcing provides a more scalable solution, it often comes at the expense of annotation precision and consistency. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to enhance the annotation process, particularly for detecting label errors in existing datasets. This study considers the recent approach of LLM-as-a-judge, leveraging an ensemble of LLMs to flag potentially mislabeled examples. Through a case study of four datasets from the TRUE benchmark, covering different tasks and domains, the study empirically analyzes the labeling quality of existing datasets, and compare expert, crowd-sourced, and the LLM-based annotations in terms of agreement, label quality, and efficiency, demonstrating the strengths and limitations of each annotation method. The findings reveal a substantial number of label errors, which, when corrected, induce a significant upward shift in reported model performance. This suggests that many of the LLMs so-called mistakes are due to label errors rather than genuine model failures. Additionally, the work discusses the implications of mislabeled data and propose methods to mitigate them in training to improve model performance. <br> <br>

57. ***Read-ME: Router-Decoupled Mixture of Experts:  <br>This research presents a framework to transform dense LLMs into efficient MoE models, addressing inference challenges and improving latency and accuracy through better system integration.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 24, The Uni of Texas at Austin and Qualcomm AI Research published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.19123) “Read-ME: Refactorizing LLMs as Router-Decoupled Mixture of Experts with System Co-Design”. The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has led to the adoption of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures that dynamically leverage specialized subnetworks for improved efficiency and performance. Despite their benefits, MoE models face significant challenges during inference, including inefficient memory management and suboptimal batching, due to misaligned design choices between the model architecture and the system policies. Furthermore, the conventional approach of training MoEs from scratch is increasingly prohibitive in terms of cost. This work proposes a novel framework Read-ME that transforms pre-trained dense LLMs into smaller MoE models (in contrast to "upcycling" generalist MoEs), avoiding the high costs of ground-up training. The approach employs activation sparsity to extract experts. To compose experts, the work examines the widely-adopted layer-wise router design and show its redundancy, and thus introducing the pre-gating router decoupled from the MoE backbone that facilitates system-friendly pre-computing and lookahead scheduling, enhancing expert-aware batching and caching. The codesign therefore addresses critical gaps on both the algorithmic and system fronts, establishing a scalable and efficient alternative for LLM inference in resource-constrained settings. Read-ME outperforms other popular open-source dense models of similar scales, achieving improvements of up to 10.1% on MMLU, and improving mean end-to-end latency up to 6.1%.

1. ***Watermark Robustness:  <br>Nanyang Tech Uni and ETH Zurich introduced "W-Bench," a benchmark for assessing watermarking robustness against editing by large text-to-image models. Traditional watermarking fails under intense edits, so they propose "VINE," a novel watermark method improving edit resilience through frequency analysis and pretrained diffusion models, enhancing watermark robustness and quality.*** <br> <br>
   Oct 24, Nanyang Tech Uni and ETH Zurich published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18775) “Robust Watermarking Using Generative Priors Against Image Editing: From Benchmarking to Advances”. Current image watermarking methods are vulnerable to advanced image editing techniques enabled by large-scale text-to-image models. These models can distort embedded watermarks during editing, posing significant challenges to copyright protection. This work introduces W-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of watermarking methods against a wide range of image editing techniques, including image regeneration, global editing, local editing, and image-to-video generation. Through extensive evaluations of eleven representative watermarking methods against prevalent editing techniques, the work demonstrates that most methods fail to detect watermarks after such edits. To address this limitation, the study proposes VINE, a watermarking method that significantly enhances robustness against various image editing techniques while maintaining high image quality. The approach involves two key innovations: (1) to analyze the frequency characteristics of image editing and identify that blurring distortions exhibit similar frequency properties, which allows to use them as surrogate attacks during training to bolster watermark robustness; (2) to leverage a large-scale pretrained diffusion model SDXL-Turbo, adapting it for the watermarking task to achieve more imperceptible and robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that the method achieves outstanding watermarking performance under various image editing techniques, outperforming existing methods in both image quality and robustness. Code is available at https://github.com/Shilin-LU/VINE. <br> <br>

3. ***Effective Context Length in LLMs:  <br>Research from Hong Kong Uni, ByteDance, and UIUC finds LLMs often utilize less than half of their training context. A novel method, STRING, adjusts position embeddings to increase effective context length, improving benchmark performance significantly on models like Llama3.1.*** <br> <br>
   Oct 24, Uni of HongKong, ByteDance and UIUC published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18745) “Why Does the Effective Context Length of LLMs Fall Short?”. Advancements in distributed training and efficient attention mechanisms have significantly expanded the context window sizes of large language models (LLMs). However, recent work reveals that the effective context lengths of open-source LLMs often fall short, typically not exceeding half of their training lengths. This work attributes this limitation to the left-skewed frequency distribution of relative positions formed in LLMs pretraining and post-training stages, which impedes their ability to effectively gather distant information. To address this challenge, the work introduce ShifTed Rotray position embeddING (STRING). STRING shifts well-trained positions to overwrite the original ineffective positions during inference, enhancing performance within their existing training lengths. Experimental results show that without additional training, STRING dramatically improves the performance of the latest large-scale models, such as Llama3.1 70B and Qwen2 72B, by over 10 points on popular long-context benchmarks RULER and InfiniteBench, establishing new state-of-the-art results for open-source LLMs. Compared to commercial models, Llama 3.1 70B with StRing even achieves better performance than GPT-4-128K and clearly surpasses Claude 2 and Kimi-chat. <br> <br>

5. ***Challenges in Model Editing:  <br>HKUST and Hong Kong Baptist Uni found that while model editing is useful for updating language model knowledge, it can degrade general abilities if edits accumulate. Large models and instruction-tuned ones show more resilience, suggesting new approaches are needed for substantial knowledge updates.*** <br> <br>
   Oct 24, HKUST and HongKong Baptist Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18785) “Should We Really Edit Language Models? On the Evaluation of Edited Language Models”. Model editing has become an increasingly popular alternative for efficiently updating knowledge within language models. Current methods mainly focus on reliability, generalization, and locality, with many methods excelling across these criteria. Some recent works disclose the pitfalls of these editing methods such as knowledge distortion or conflict. However, the general abilities of post-edited language models remain unexplored. This study performs a comprehensive evaluation on various editing methods and different language models, and have following findings. (1) Existing editing methods lead to inevitable performance deterioration on general benchmarks, indicating that existing editing methods maintain the general abilities of the model within only a few dozen edits. When the number of edits is slightly large, the intrinsic knowledge structure of the model is disrupted or even completely damaged. (2) Instruction-tuned models are more robust to editing, showing less performance drop on general knowledge after editing. (3) Language model with large scale is more resistant to editing compared to small model. (4) The safety of the edited model, is significantly weakened, even for those safety-aligned models. The findings indicate that current editing methods are only suitable for small-scale knowledge updates within language models, which motivates further research on more practical and reliable editing methods.

7. ***Reducing LLM Hallucinations:  <br>Researchers from the Uni of Edinburgh and partners propose DeCoRe, a decoding strategy that contrasts retrieval head outputs to improve factual accuracy in LLMs. By contrasting masked and base LLM outputs, DeCoRe effectively reduces hallucinations in tasks like summarization and question answering.*** <br> <br>
   Oct 24, Uni of Edinburgh, Miniml.AI, AstraZeneca and Uni College London published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18860) “DeCoRe: Decoding by Contrasting Retrieval Heads to Mitigate Hallucinations”. Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate, producing unfaithful or factually incorrect outputs by misrepresenting the provided context or incorrectly recalling internal knowledge. Recent studies have identified specific attention heads within the Transformer architecture, known as retrieval heads, responsible for extracting relevant contextual information. The study hypothesises that masking these retrieval heads can induce hallucinations and that contrasting the outputs of the base LLM and the masked LLM can reduce hallucinations. To this end, the study proposes Decoding by Contrasting Retrieval Heads (DeCoRe), a novel training-free decoding strategy that amplifies information found in the context and model parameters. DeCoRe mitigates potentially hallucinated responses by dynamically contrasting the outputs of the base LLM and the masked LLM, using conditional entropy as a guide. Extensive experiments confirm that DeCoRe significantly improves performance on tasks requiring high contextual faithfulness, such as summarisation (XSum by 18.6%), instruction following (MemoTrap by 10.9%), and open-book question answering (NQ-Open by 2.4% and NQ-Swap by 5.5%). <br> <br>

9. ***Scalable LLM Watermarking:  <br>Google’s "SynthID-Text" is a scalable watermarking tool that accurately identifies synthetic text without impairing text quality, integrating with speculative sampling for production-level efficiency. A live experiment confirms high detection accuracy and text quality retention in large-scale deployments.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 23, Google published a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08025-4) on Nature “Scalable watermarking for identifying large language model outputs”. Large language models (LLMs) have enabled the generation of high-quality synthetic text, often indistinguishable from human-written content, at a scale that can markedly affect the nature of the information ecosystem. Watermarking can help identify synthetic text and limit accidental or deliberate misuse, but has not been adopted in production systems owing to stringent quality, detectability and computational efficiency requirements. Here the study describes SynthID-Text, a production-ready text watermarking scheme that preserves text quality and enables high detection accuracy, with minimal latency overhead. SynthID-Text does not affect LLM training and modifies only the sampling procedure; watermark detection is computationally efficient, without using the underlying LLM. To enable watermarking at scale, the study develops an algorithm integrating watermarking with speculative sampling, an efficiency technique frequently used in production systems. Evaluations across multiple LLMs empirically show that SynthID-Text provides improved detectability over comparable methods, and standard benchmarks and human side-by-side ratings indicate no change in LLM capabilities. To demonstrate the feasibility of watermarking in large-scale-production systems, the researchers conducted a live experiment that assessed feedback from nearly 20 million Gemini responses, again confirming the preservation of text quality. The authors hope that the availability of SynthID-Text7 will facilitate further development of watermarking and responsible use of LLM systems. <br> <br>

11. ***Scaling Diffusion Language Models:  <br>Researchers propose adapting autoregressive models into diffusion models for scalable text generation. This adaptation, named DiffuGPT and DiffuLLaMA, performs comparably to AR models and excels in in-context learning. Their models, spanning various sizes, enhance text generation diversity.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 23, The Uni of HongKong, UIUC, Apple and Tencent published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17891) “Scaling Diffusion Language Models via Adaptation from Autoregressive Models”. Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising new paradigm for text generative modeling, potentially addressing limitations of autoregressive (AR) models. However, current DLMs have been studied at a smaller scale compared to their AR counterparts and lack fair comparison on language modeling benchmarks. Additionally, training diffusion models from scratch at scale remains challenging. Given the prevalence of open-source AR language models, the work proposes adapting these models to build text diffusion models. The study demonstrates connections between AR and diffusion modeling objectives and introduce a simple continual pre-training approach for training diffusion models. Through systematic evaluation on language modeling, reasoning, and commonsense benchmarks, the work shows that it is able to convert AR models ranging from 127M to 7B parameters (GPT2 and LLaMA) into diffusion models DiffuGPT and DiffuLLaMA, using less than 200B tokens for training. Experimental results reveal that these models outperform earlier DLMs and are competitive with their AR counterparts. The authors release a suite of DLMs (with 127M, 355M, and 7B parameters) capable of generating fluent text, performing in-context learning, filling in the middle without prompt re-ordering, and following instructions https://github.com/HKUNLP/DiffuLLaMA. <br> <br>

13. ***Autonomous AI Agents in Business:  <br>Microsoft’s AI-powered autonomous agents enhance business productivity by automating routine tasks and improving customer experience. Created through Copilot Studio, these agents are efficient, secure, and represent a significant leap in business automation.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 22, Microsoft is revolutionizing business processes with the introduction of [autonomous agents](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/10/21/new-autonomous-agents-scale-your-team-like-never-before/), AI-powered tools designed to streamline tasks and enhance productivity across various departments. These agents can be created using the Copilot Studio platform or selected from a range of pre-built options available in Dynamics 365. Key benefits of autonomous agents include: 1) Increased efficiency - Automating routine tasks frees up employees to focus on more strategic work. 2) Cost reduction - Streamlining processes and reducing manual errors can lead to significant cost savings. 3) Improved customer experience - Agents can provide faster and more accurate responses to customer inquiries. Microsoft is also emphasizing the importance of data security and responsible AI in the development and deployment of autonomous agents. By ensuring that these tools adhere to strict privacy and ethical standards, businesses can confidently adopt them without compromising their customers' trust. With the potential to transform industries and drive competitive advantage, autonomous agents represent a significant step forward in the world of AI and business automation. Forbes reported this news as “Imagine walking into your office to find that your company just hired thousands of new employees overnight – except they're not human. That's exactly what Microsoft has made possible with its groundbreaking announcement of autonomous AI agents, marking a fundamental shift in how businesses will operate in the coming years.” <br> <br>

15. ***LLMs and Instruction-following Uncertainty:  <br>Uni of Cambridge, NUS, and Apple research highlights that LLMs struggle with instruction-following consistency. They propose benchmarks to assess uncertainty in LLM responses, identifying gaps in current uncertainty methods, especially in complex instructions, prompting future improvements.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 22, Uni of Cambridge, National Uni of Singapore and Apple published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14582) “Do LLMs estimate uncertainty well in instruction-following?”. Large language models (LLMs) could be valuable personal AI agents across various domains, provided they can precisely follow user instructions. However, recent studies have shown significant limitations in LLMs' instruction-following capabilities, raising concerns about their reliability in high-stakes applications. Accurately estimating LLMs' uncertainty in adhering to instructions is critical to mitigating deployment risks. The study presents the first systematic evaluation of the uncertainty estimation abilities of LLMs in the context of instruction-following. The study identifies key challenges with existing instruction-following benchmarks, where multiple factors are entangled with uncertainty stems from instruction-following, complicating the isolation and comparison across methods and models. To address these issues, the study introduces a controlled evaluation setup with two benchmark versions of data, enabling a comprehensive comparison of uncertainty estimation methods under various conditions. The findings show that existing uncertainty methods struggle, particularly when models make subtle errors in instruction following. While internal model states provide some improvement, they remain inadequate in more complex scenarios. The insights from the controlled evaluation setups provide a crucial understanding of LLMs' limitations and potential for uncertainty estimation in instruction-following tasks, paving the way for more trustworthy AI agents. <br> <br>

17. ***Vision-Language Model Benchmarking:  <br>CMU and the Uni of Washington introduce NaturalBench, a VLM benchmark with adversarial samples requiring advanced reasoning. They show VLMs lag behind humans in complex visio-linguistic tasks, highlighting gaps in model comprehension of visual details and commonsense priors.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 22, CMU and Uni of Washington published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14669) “NaturalBench: Evaluating Vision-Language Models on Natural Adversarial Samples”. Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent visual-question-answering (VQA) benchmarks that evaluate complex visio-linguistic reasoning. However, are these models truly effective? This study shows that VLMs still struggle with natural images and questions that humans can easily answer, which is termed as natural adversarial samples. The study also finds it surprisingly easy to generate these VQA samples from natural image-text corpora using off-the-shelf models like CLIP and ChatGPT. The work proposes a semi-automated approach to collect a new benchmark, NaturalBench, for reliably evaluating VLMs with 10,000 human-verified VQA samples. Crucially, the study adopts a vision-centric design by pairing each question with two images that yield different answers, preventing blind solutions from answering without using the images. This makes NaturalBench more challenging than previous benchmarks that can be solved with commonsense priors. The study evaluates 53 state-of-the-art VLMs on NaturalBench, showing that models like LLaVA-OneVision, Cambrian-1, Llama3.2-Vision, Molmo, Qwen2-VL, and even GPT-4o lag 50%-70% behind human performance (over 90%). The authors analyze why NaturalBench is hard from two angles: (1) Compositionality: Solving NaturalBench requires diverse visio-linguistic skills, including understanding attribute bindings, object relationships, and advanced reasoning like logic and counting. To this end, unlike prior work that uses a single tag per sample, the work tags each NaturalBench sample with 1 to 8 skill tags for fine-grained evaluation. (2) Biases: NaturalBench exposes severe biases in VLMs, as models often choose the same answer regardless of the image. Lastly, the authors apply the benchmark curation method to diverse data sources, including long captions (over 100 words) and non-English languages like Chinese and Hindi, highlighting its potential for dynamic evaluations of VLMs. <br> <br>

19. ***Improving Model Generalization with Layer Scaling:  <br>Researchers from EPFL, Google, and Uni of Geneva propose LiNeS, a method for scaling model updates by layer depth to enhance fine-tuning without forgetting core knowledge. LiNeS boosts single- and multi-task performance, particularly in multi-task model merging.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 22, EPFL, Google, and Uni of Geneva published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17146) “LiNeS: Post-training Layer Scaling Prevents Forgetting and Enhances Model Merging”. Large pre-trained models exhibit impressive zero-shot performance across diverse tasks, but fine-tuning often leads to catastrophic forgetting, where improvements on a target domain degrade generalization on other tasks. To address this challenge, the work introduces LiNeS, Layer-increasing Network Scaling, a post-training editing technique designed to preserve pre-trained generalization while enhancing fine-tuned task performance. LiNeS scales parameter updates linearly based on their layer depth within the network, maintaining shallow layers close to their pre-trained values to preserve general features while allowing deeper layers to retain task-specific representations. The work further extends this approach to multi-task model merging scenarios, where layer-wise scaling of merged parameters reduces negative task interference. LiNeS demonstrates significant improvements in both single-task and multi-task settings across various benchmarks in vision and natural language processing. It mitigates forgetting, enhances out-of-distribution generalization, integrates seamlessly with existing multi-task model merging baselines improving their performance across benchmarks and model sizes, and can boost generalization when merging LLM policies aligned with different rewards via RLHF. Importantly, the method is simple to implement and complementary to many existing techniques. [Code is here](https://github.com/wang-kee/LiNeS). <br> <br>

21. ***Multilingual and Multimodal LLM:  <br>CMU's Pangea model supports 39 languages, addressing the lack of multilingual multimodal models. With a culturally relevant evaluation suite, Pangea outperforms existing models in linguistic and cultural inclusivity, opening avenues for equitable AI development.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 21, CMU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16153) “Pangea: A Fully Open Multilingual Multimodal LLM supporting 39 languages”. Despite recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their development has predominantly focused on English- and western-centric datasets and tasks, leaving most of the world's languages and diverse cultural contexts underrepresented. This paper introduces Pangea, a multilingual multimodal LLM trained on PangeaIns, a diverse 6M instruction dataset spanning 39 languages. PangeaIns features: 1) high-quality English instructions, 2) carefully machine-translated instructions, and 3) culturally relevant multimodal tasks to ensure cross-cultural coverage. To rigorously assess models' capabilities, the study introduces PangeaBench, a holistic evaluation suite encompassing 14 datasets covering 47 languages. Results show that Pangea significantly outperforms existing open-source models in multilingual settings and diverse cultural contexts. Ablation studies further reveal the importance of English data proportions, language popularity, and the number of multimodal training samples on overall performance. The authors fully open-source the data, code, and trained checkpoints, to facilitate the development of inclusive and robust multilingual MLLMs, promoting equity and accessibility across a broader linguistic and cultural spectrum. <br> <br>

23. ***No-code Model Training:  <br>Hugging Face's AutoTrain tool enables no-code training across model types and modalities. It streamlines training for various tasks, including LLM fine-tuning, image classification, and regression on custom datasets, making advanced model development accessible and efficient.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 21, Hugging face published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15735) “AutoTrain: No-code training for state-of-the-art models”. With the advancements in open-source models, training (or finetuning) models on custom datasets has become a crucial part of developing solutions which are tailored to specific industrial or open-source applications. Yet, there is no single tool which simplifies the process of training across different types of modalities or tasks. The study introduces AutoTrain (aka AutoTrain Advanced) -- an open-source, no code tool/library which can be used to train (or finetune) models for different kinds of tasks such as: large language model (LLM) finetuning, text classification/regression, token classification, sequence-to-sequence task, finetuning of sentence transformers, visual language model (VLM) finetuning, image classification/regression and even classification and regression tasks on tabular data. AutoTrain Advanced is an open-source library providing best practices for training models on custom datasets. The library is available at https://github.com/huggingface/autotrain-advanced. AutoTrain can be used in fully local mode or on cloud machines and works with tens of thousands of models shared on Hugging Face Hub and their variations. <br> <br>

25. ***Adaptive Reasoning with SMART:  <br>ETH and Microsoft propose SMART, a meta-strategy agent for reasoning tasks that allows LLMs to self-learn optimal reasoning strategies, eliminating the need for multiple inference passes. SMART improves reasoning efficiency, especially in complex deductive tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 21, ETH and Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16128) “SMART: Self-learning Meta-strategy Agent for Reasoning Tasks”. Tasks requiring deductive reasoning, especially those involving multiple steps, often demand adaptive strategies such as intermediate generation of rationales or programs, as no single approach is universally optimal. While Language Models (LMs) can enhance their outputs through iterative self-refinement and strategy adjustments, they frequently fail to apply the most effective strategy in their first attempt. This inefficiency raises the question: Can LMs learn to select the optimal strategy in the first attempt, without a need for refinement? To address this challenge, the study introduces SMART (Self-learning Meta-strategy Agent for Reasoning Tasks), a novel framework that enables LMs to autonomously learn and select the most effective strategies for various reasoning tasks. The authors model the strategy selection process as a Markov Decision Process and leverage reinforcement learning-driven continuous self-improvement to allow the model to find the suitable strategy to solve a given task. Unlike traditional self-refinement methods that rely on multiple inference passes or external feedback, SMART allows an LM to internalize the outcomes of its own reasoning processes and adjust its strategy accordingly, aiming for correct solutions on the first attempt. Experiments across various reasoning datasets and with different model architectures demonstrate that SMART significantly enhances the ability of models to choose optimal strategies without external guidance (+15 points on the GSM8K dataset). By achieving higher accuracy with a single inference pass, SMART not only improves performance but also reduces computational costs for refinement-based strategies, paving the way for more efficient and intelligent reasoning in LMs.  <br> <br>

27. ***Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in VLMs:  <br>CMU and Apple introduce methods to enhance VLM reasoning by distilling rationales and using reinforcement learning, significantly improving Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Their approach enriches model training and aligns it with more nuanced reasoning tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 21, CMU and Apple published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16198) “Improve Vision Language Model Chain-of-thought Reasoning”. Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in vision language models (VLMs) is crucial for improving interpretability and trustworthiness. However, current training recipes lack robust CoT reasoning data, relying on datasets dominated by short annotations with minimal rationales. This work shows that training VLM on short answers does not generalize well to reasoning tasks that require more detailed responses. To address this, the study proposes a two-fold approach. First, the study distills rationales from GPT-4o model to enrich the training data and fine-tune VLMs, boosting their CoT performance. Second, the authors apply reinforcement learning to further calibrate reasoning quality. Specifically, the study constructs positive (correct) and negative (incorrect) pairs of model-generated reasoning chains, by comparing their predictions with annotated short answers. Using this pairwise data, the study applies the Direct Preference Optimization algorithm to refine the model's reasoning abilities. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in CoT reasoning on benchmark datasets and better generalization to direct answer prediction as well. This work emphasizes the importance of incorporating detailed rationales in training and leveraging reinforcement learning to strengthen the reasoning capabilities of VLMs. <br> <br>

29. ***Benchmarking Knowledge Editing for Hallucination Correction:  <br>CMU and Emory Uni created HalluEditBench to evaluate knowledge editing methods in reducing LLM hallucinations. They benchmark various methods across domains and highlight the strengths and weaknesses in current hallucination correction techniques.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 21, Illinois Inst of Tech, Cisco and Emory Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16251) “Can Knowledge Editing Really Correct Hallucinations?”. Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from hallucinations, referring to the non-factual information in generated content, despite their superior capacities across tasks. Meanwhile, knowledge editing has been developed as a new popular paradigm to correct the erroneous factual knowledge encoded in LLMs with the advantage of avoiding retraining from scratch. However, one common issue of existing evaluation datasets for knowledge editing is that they do not ensure LLMs actually generate hallucinated answers to the evaluation questions before editing. When LLMs are evaluated on such datasets after being edited by different techniques, it is hard to directly adopt the performance to assess the effectiveness of different knowledge editing methods in correcting hallucinations. Thus, the fundamental question remains insufficiently validated: Can knowledge editing really correct hallucinations in LLMs? The study proposed HalluEditBench to holistically benchmark knowledge editing methods in correcting real-world hallucinations. First, the work rigorously constructs a massive hallucination dataset with 9 domains, 26 topics and more than 6,000 hallucinations. Then, the study assesses the performance of knowledge editing methods in a holistic way on five dimensions including Efficacy, Generalization, Portability, Locality, and Robustness. Through HalluEditBench, the work have provided new insights into the potentials and limitations of different knowledge editing methods in correcting hallucinations, which could inspire future improvements and facilitate the progress in the field of knowledge editing. <br> <br>

31. ***Improving Parallel Program Performance:  <br>Stanford, Intel, Nvidia, and Visa Research propose using LLM-driven optimizers to design specialized low-level system code (mappers) for parallel programming. This approach automates mapper generation, surpassing expert designs in scientific applications by up to 1.34x in speed. The study uses a domain-specific language to simplify low-level code generation, improving efficiency and reducing engineers’ workload.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 21, Stanford Uni, Intel, Nvidia and Visa Research published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15625) “Improving Parallel Program Performance Through DSL-Driven Code Generation with LLM Optimizers”. Mapping computations to processors and assigning data to memory are critical for maximizing performance in parallel programming. These mapping decisions are managed through the development of specialized low-level system code, called mappers, crafted by performance engineers. Each mapper is tailored to a specific application and optimized for the underlying machine architecture, a process that requires days of refinement and tuning from an expert. Despite advances in system research, automating mapper generation remains a challenge due to the complexity of making millions of decisions to find the optimal solution and generate the solution as code. The study introduces an approach that leverages recent advances in LLM-based optimizers for mapper design. In under ten minutes, the method automatically discovers mappers that surpass human expert designs in scientific applications by up to 1.34X speedup. For parallel matrix multiplication algorithms, the mapper achieves up to 1.31X of the expert-designed solution. To achieve this, the authors simplify the complexity of low-level code generation by introducing a domain-specific language (DSL) that abstracts the low-level system programming details and defines a structured search space for LLMs to explore. To maximize the application performance, the study uses an LLM optimizer to improve an agentic system that generates the mapper code. As a result, this approach significantly reduces the workload for performance engineers while achieving substantial performance gains across diverse applications. Finally, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-based optimization in system design and suggest its potential for addressing other complex system challenges. <br> <br>

33. ***Influence of Training on Vision Models:  <br>Offenburg University and collaborators examine how training methods impact neural networks’ decision-critical layers. Findings suggest that training regimes affect which layers are essential, with improved training increasing the importance of early layers, while adversarial training shifts importance to deeper layers.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 18, Offenburg Uni, Uni of Mannheim and Max-Planck-Inst published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14470) “How Do Training Methods Influence the Utilization of Vision Models?”. Not all learnable parameters (e.g., weights) contribute equally to a neural network's decision function. In fact, entire layers' parameters can sometimes be reset to random values with little to no impact on the model's decisions. The work revisits earlier studies that examined how architecture and task complexity influence this phenomenon and ask: is this phenomenon also affected by how to train the model? The work conducted experimental evaluations on a diverse set of ImageNet-1k classification models to explore this, keeping the architecture and training data constant but varying the training pipeline. The findings reveal that the training method strongly influences which layers become critical to the decision function for a given task. For example, improved training regimes and self-supervised training increase the importance of early layers while significantly under-utilizing deeper layers. In contrast, methods such as adversarial training display an opposite trend. The preliminary results extend previous findings, offering a more nuanced understanding of the inner mechanics of neural networks. Code: https://github.com/paulgavrikov/layer_criticality <br> <br>

35. ***In-context Learning and Occam's Razor:  <br>Researchers at Mila and Université de Montréal link Occam's razor with in-context learning, where certain sequence models learn from past context. Their findings show that models can minimize both training error and model complexity by learning within context, revealing limitations and improvement areas for in-context learning methods.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 17, Mila and Uni de Montreal published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14086) “In-context learning and Occam's razor”. The goal of machine learning is generalization. While the No Free Lunch Theorem states that people cannot obtain theoretical guarantees for generalization without further assumptions, in practice people observe that simple models which explain the training data generalize best: a principle called Occam's razor. Despite the need for simple models, most current approaches in machine learning only minimize the training error, and at best indirectly promote simplicity through regularization or architecture design. Here, the study draws a connection between Occam's razor and in-context learning: an emergent ability of certain sequence models like Transformers to learn at inference time from past observations in a sequence. In particular, the study shows that the next-token prediction loss used to train in-context learners is directly equivalent to a data compression technique called prequential coding, and that minimizing this loss amounts to jointly minimizing both the training error and the complexity of the model that was implicitly learned from context. The theory and the empirical experiments used to support it not only provide a normative account of in-context learning, but also elucidate the shortcomings of current in-context learning methods, suggesting ways in which they can be improved.

37. ***Introspection in LLMs:  <br>UC San Diego and others explore LLM introspection, or the model's self-assessment of internal states. The study finds that models like GPT-4 outperform others in predicting their behavior, suggesting LLMs’ ability to introspect and enhancing interpretability, though only for simpler tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 17, UC San Diego, Stanford Uni, Truthful AI, Anthropic, Scale AI, NYU, UC Berkeley et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13787) “Looking Inward: Language Models Can Learn About Themselves by Introspection”. Humans acquire knowledge by observing the external world, but also by introspection. Introspection gives a person privileged access to their current state of mind (e.g., thoughts and feelings) that is not accessible to external observers. Can LLMs introspect? The study defines introspection as acquiring knowledge that is not contained in or derived from training data but instead originates from internal states. Such a capability could enhance model interpretability. Instead of painstakingly analyzing a model's internal workings, the study could simply ask the model about its beliefs, world models, and goals. More speculatively, an introspective model might self-report on whether it possesses certain internal states such as subjective feelings or desires and this could inform human about the moral status of these states. Such self-reports would not be entirely dictated by the model's training data. The authors study introspection by finetuning LLMs to predict properties of their own behavior in hypothetical scenarios. For example, "Given the input P, would your output favor the short- or long-term option?" If a model M1 can introspect, it should outperform a different model M2 in predicting M1's behavior even if M2 is trained on M1's ground-truth behavior. The idea is that M1 has privileged access to its own behavioral tendencies, and this enables it to predict itself better than M2 (even if M2 is generally stronger). In experiments with GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Llama-3 models (each finetuned to predict itself), the study finds that the model M1 outperforms M2 in predicting itself, providing evidence for introspection. Notably, M1 continues to predict its behavior accurately even after the authors intentionally modify its ground-truth behavior. However, while the study successfully elicit introspection on simple tasks, the work is unsuccessful on more complex tasks or those requiring out-of-distribution generalization. <br> <br>

39. ***LLM Hallucination in Multi-Document Summarization (MDS):  <br>Researchers at UC Irvine and Megagon Labs highlight challenges of hallucinations in MDS, finding that up to 75% of generated content is hallucinated, particularly towards summary ends. They identify a need for more effective approaches to mitigate hallucination.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 17, Uni of California Irvine and Megagon Labs published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13961) “From Single to Multi: How LLMs Hallucinate in Multi-Document Summarization”. Although many studies have investigated and reduced hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) for single-document tasks, research on hallucination in multi-document summarization (MDS) tasks remains largely unexplored. Specifically, it is unclear how the challenges arising from handling multiple documents (e.g., repetition and diversity of information) affect models outputs. This study investigates how hallucinations manifest in LLMs when summarizing topic-specific information from multiple documents. Since no benchmarks exist for investigating hallucinations in MDS, the work uses existing news and conversation datasets, annotated with topic-specific insights, to create two novel multi-document benchmarks. When evaluating 5 LLMs on the benchmarks, the authors observe that on average, up to 75% of the content in LLM-generated summary is hallucinated, with hallucinations more likely to occur towards the end of the summaries. Moreover, when summarizing non-existent topic-related information, gpt-3.5-turbo and GPT-4o still generate summaries about 79.35% and 44% of the time, raising concerns about their tendency to fabricate content. To understand the characteristics of these hallucinations, the authors manually evaluate 700+ insights and find that most errors stem from either failing to follow instructions or producing overly generic insights. Motivated by these observations, the study investigates the efficacy of simple post-hoc baselines in mitigating hallucinations but find them only moderately effective. The results underscore the need for more effective approaches to systematically mitigate hallucinations in MDS.

41. ***Foundation Model for Physical Signals:  <br>Archetype AI proposes a foundation model for physical signals, generalizing across varied phenomena and sensors. Trained on cross-modal data, the model demonstrates adaptability to complex physical behaviors, aiming for a unified AI model for diverse physical processes.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 15, Archetype AI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14724) “A Phenomenological AI Foundation Model for Physical Signals”. The objective of this work is to develop an AI foundation model for physical signals that can generalize across diverse phenomena, domains, applications, and sensing apparatuses. The study proposes a phenomenological approach and framework for creating and validating such AI foundation models. Based on this framework, the study developed and trained a model on 0.59 billion samples of cross-modal sensor measurements, ranging from electrical current to fluid flow to optical sensors. Notably, no prior knowledge of physical laws or inductive biases were introduced into the model. Through several real-world experiments, the study demonstrates that a single foundation model could effectively encode and predict physical behaviors, such as mechanical motion and thermodynamics, including phenomena not seen in training. The model also scales across physical processes of varying complexity, from tracking the trajectory of a simple spring-mass system to forecasting large electrical grid dynamics. This work highlights the potential of building a unified AI foundation model for diverse physical world processes. <br> <br>

43. ***Scaling Continuous-Time Consistency Models:  <br>OpenAI addresses instability in continuous-time consistency models by enhancing training stability and simplifying parameterization. Their model achieves near-state-of-the-art FID scores on large-scale image datasets, bridging the performance gap with top diffusion models.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 14, OpenAI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11081) “Simplifying, Stabilizing and Scaling Continuous-Time Consistency Models”. Consistency models (CMs) are a powerful class of diffusion-based generative models optimized for fast sampling. Most existing CMs are trained using discretized timesteps, which introduce additional hyperparameters and are prone to discretization errors. While continuous-time formulations can mitigate these issues, their success has been limited by training instability. To address this, the study proposes a simplified theoretical framework that unifies previous parameterizations of diffusion models and CMs, identifying the root causes of instability. Based on this analysis, the work introduces key improvements in diffusion process parameterization, network architecture, and training objectives. These changes enable to train continuous-time CMs at an unprecedented scale, reaching 1.5B parameters on ImageNet 512x512. The proposed training algorithm, using only two sampling steps, achieves FID scores of 2.06 on CIFAR-10, 1.48 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.88 on ImageNet 512x512, narrowing the gap in FID scores with the best existing diffusion models to within 10%. <br> <br>

45. ***Astute RAG for Enhanced Retrieval Robustness:  <br>Google and USC propose "Astute RAG," a method to improve RAG by resolving conflicts between LLM internal knowledge and retrieved external information, enhancing accuracy and trustworthiness even under imperfect retrieval conditions.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 9, Google and Uni of Southern California published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07176) “Astute RAG: Overcoming Imperfect Retrieval Augmentation and Knowledge Conflicts for Large Language Models”. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), while effective in integrating external knowledge to address the limitations of large language models (LLMs), can be undermined by imperfect retrieval, which may introduce irrelevant, misleading, or even malicious information. Despite its importance, previous studies have rarely explored the behavior of RAG through joint analysis on how errors from imperfect retrieval attribute and propagate, and how potential conflicts arise between the LLMs' internal knowledge and external sources. The work finds that imperfect retrieval augmentation might be inevitable and quite harmful, through controlled analysis under realistic conditions. The study identifies the knowledge conflicts between LLM-internal and external knowledge from retrieval as a bottleneck to overcome in the post-retrieval stage of RAG. To render LLMs resilient to imperfect retrieval, the work proposes Astute RAG, a novel RAG approach that adaptively elicits essential information from LLMs' internal knowledge, iteratively consolidates internal and external knowledge with source-awareness, and finalizes the answer according to information reliability. Experiments using Gemini and Claude demonstrate that Astute RAG significantly outperforms previous robustness-enhanced RAG methods. Notably, Astute RAG is the only approach that matches or exceeds the performance of LLMs without RAG under worst-case scenarios. Further analysis reveals that Astute RAG effectively resolves knowledge conflicts, improving the reliability and trustworthiness of RAG systems. <br> <br>

47. ***LLMs as 'Consensus Machines':  <br>Harvard research finds LLMs operate like crowdsourcing platforms, often generating consensus-based answers rather than expert knowledge. Models perform well on general questions but struggle with specialized or controversial topics, underscoring the importance of training data quality for accuracy.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 7, the decoder published an [article](https://the-decoder.com/llms-are-consensus-machines-similar-to-crowdsourcing-harvard-study-finds/) “LLMs are 'consensus machines' similar to crowdsourcing, Harvard study finds” summarized a recent Harvard [research paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3688007). The new Harvard study suggests that large language models (LLMs) work much like crowdsourcing platforms, generating the most likely answer based on the questions and answers available online rather than relying on expert knowledge. The researchers tested different AI models with questions of varying degrees of ambiguity and controversy, and found that the models often provided correct answers on topics with broad consensus, but struggled with more specific or controversial questions, particularly when citing scientific papers. The study advises caution when using AI-generated content for specialized or polarizing topics, as accuracy is highly dependent on the breadth and quality of the training data.

1. ***Bridging Training-Inference Gap:  <br>CMU, University of Minnesota, and Amazon proposed two techniques to reduce discrepancies between training and inference in language models. They introduced Batch-Scheduled Sampling, which alternates between ground-truth tokens and self-generated ones during training, and Reference-Answer-based Correction, allowing models to self-correct during training. These methods improved model performance across summarization and question-answering tasks.*** <br> <br>
   Oct 18, CMU, Uni of Minnesota and Amazon published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14655) “Bridging the Training-Inference Gap in LLMs by Leveraging Self-Generated Tokens”. Language models are often trained to maximize the likelihood of the next token given past tokens in the training dataset. However, during inference time, they are utilized differently, generating text sequentially and auto-regressively by using previously generated tokens as input to predict the next one. Marginal differences in predictions at each step can cascade over successive steps, resulting in different distributions from what the models were trained for and potentially leading to unpredictable behavior. This paper proposes two simple approaches based on model own generation to address this discrepancy between the training and inference time. The first approach is Batch-Scheduled Sampling, where, during training, the work stochastically chooses between the ground-truth token from the dataset and the model's own generated token as input to predict the next token. This is done in an offline manner, modifying the context window by interleaving ground-truth tokens with those generated by the model. The second approach is Reference-Answer-based Correction, where the study explicitly incorporates a self-correction capability into the model during training. This enables the model to effectively self-correct the gaps between the generated sequences and the ground truth data without relying on an external oracle model. By incorporating the proposed strategies during training, the study have observed an overall improvement in performance compared to baseline methods, as demonstrated by the extensive experiments using summarization, general question-answering, and math question-answering tasks. <br> <br>

3. ***Retrospective Learning from Interactions: Cornell University introduced ReSpect, a method for LLMs to learn from user feedback in past interactions. By using implicit feedback signals like user frustration, ReSpect improved task completion rates from 31% to 82% in multimodal interaction tasks without external annotations.***
   Oct 17, Cornell Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13852v1) “Retrospective Learning from Interactions”. Multi-turn interactions between large language models (LLMs) and users naturally include implicit feedback signals. If an LLM responds in an unexpected way to an instruction, the user is likely to signal it by rephrasing the request, expressing frustration, or pivoting to an alternative task. Such signals are task-independent and occupy a relatively constrained subspace of language, allowing the LLM to identify them even if it fails on the actual task. This creates an avenue for continually learning from interactions without additional annotations. The work introduces ReSpect, a method to learn from such signals in past interactions via retrospection. The authors deploy ReSpect in a new multimodal interaction scenario, where humans instruct an LLM to solve an abstract reasoning task with a combinatorial solution space. Through thousands of interactions with humans, the study shows how ReSpect gradually improves task completion rate from 31% to 82%, all without any external annotation.

5. ***Political Correctness and Jailbreaks in LLMs:  <br>Theori Inc explored how LLM safety measures introduce biases similar to Political Correctness (PC), leading to vulnerabilities in jailbreaks. The paper highlighted discrepancies in success rates across demographic keywords and introduced PCDefense, a defense mechanism for preventing jailbreak attempts.*** <br> <br>
   Oct 17, Theori Inc published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13334) “Do LLMs Have Political Correctness? Analyzing Ethical Biases and Jailbreak Vulnerabilities in AI Systems”. Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive proficiency in various tasks, they present potential safety risks, such as ‘jailbreaks’, where malicious inputs can coerce LLMs into generating harmful content. To address these issues, many LLM developers have implemented various safety measures to align these models. This alignment involves several techniques, including data filtering during pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and red-teaming exercises. These methods often introduce deliberate and intentional biases similar to Political Correctness (PC) to ensure the ethical behavior of LLMs. This study delves into the intentional biases injected into LLMs for safety purposes and examine methods to circumvent these safety alignment techniques. Notably, these intentional biases result in a jailbreaking success rate in GPT-4o models that differs by 20% between non-binary and cisgender keywords and by 16% between white and black keywords, even when the other parts of the prompts are identical. The study introduces the concept of PCJailbreak, highlighting the inherent risks posed by these safety-induced biases. Additionally, the study proposes an efficient defense method PCDefense, which prevents jailbreak attempts by injecting defense prompts prior to generation. PCDefense stands as an appealing alternative to Guard Models, such as Llama-Guard, that require additional inference cost after text generation. The findings emphasize the urgent need for LLM developers to adopt a more responsible approach when designing and implementing safety measures. <br> <br>

7. ***Agent-as-a-Judge Framework:  <br>Meta and KAUST proposed using Agentic Systems to evaluate other agentic systems. Their Agent-as-a-Judge framework applies intermediate feedback during task-solving and outperforms traditional evaluation methods. The benchmark tool DevAI was introduced to demonstrate its effectiveness in code generation tasks.*** <br> <br>
   Oct 16, Meta and KAUST published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10934) “Agent-as-a-Judge: Evaluate Agents with Agents”. Contemporary evaluation techniques are inadequate for agentic systems. These approaches either focus exclusively on final outcomes -- ignoring the step-by-step nature of agentic systems, or require excessive manual labour. To address this, the study introduces the Agent-as-a-Judge framework, wherein agentic systems are used to evaluate agentic systems. This is an organic extension of the LLM-as-a-Judge framework, incorporating agentic features that enable intermediate feedback for the entire task-solving process. The authors apply the Agent-as-a-Judge to the task of code generation. To overcome issues with existing benchmarks and provide a proof-of-concept testbed for Agent-as-a-Judge, the work presents DevAI, a new benchmark of 55 realistic automated AI development tasks. It includes rich manual annotations, like a total of 365 hierarchical user requirements. The study benchmarks three of the popular agentic systems using Agent-as-a-Judge and find it dramatically outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge and is as reliable as human evaluation baseline. Altogether, the authors believe that Agent-as-a-Judge marks a concrete step forward for modern agentic systems -- by providing rich and reliable reward signals necessary for dynamic and scalable self-improvement.

9. ***Efficient Private Inference with AERO:  <br>NYU developed AERO, a framework that refines LLM architecture for Private Inference by removing nonlinearities like LayerNorm. AERO reduced communication and latency costs in LLM inference by focusing on a Softmax-only architecture, achieving improved privacy and efficiency.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 16, NYU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13060) “AERO: Softmax-Only LLMs for Efficient Private Inference”. The pervasiveness of proprietary language models has raised privacy concerns for users' sensitive data, emphasizing the need for private inference (PI), where inference is performed directly on encrypted inputs. However, current PI methods face prohibitively higher communication and latency overheads, primarily due to nonlinear operations. This work presents a comprehensive analysis to understand the role of nonlinearities in transformer-based decoder-only language models. The study introduces AERO, a four-step architectural optimization framework that refines the existing LLM architecture for efficient PI by systematically removing nonlinearities such as LayerNorm and GELU and reducing FLOPs counts. For the first time, the study proposes a Softmax-only architecture with significantly fewer FLOPs tailored for efficient PI. Furthermore, the work devises a novel entropy regularization technique to improve the performance of Softmax-only models. AERO achieves up to 4.23times communication and 1.94times latency reduction. The authors validate the effectiveness of AERO by benchmarking it against the state-of-the-art. <br> <br>

11. ***Mixture-of-Experts as Embedding Models:  <br>The University of Maryland examined how Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs can serve as embedding models without finetuning. The study proposed MoEE, which combines expert routing weights and hidden states, improving performance on embedding tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 16, Uni of Maryland published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10814) “Your Mixture-of-Experts LLM Is Secretly an Embedding Model For Free”. While large language models (LLMs) excel on generation tasks, their decoder-only architecture often limits their potential as embedding models if no further representation finetuning is applied. Does this contradict their claim of generalists? To answer the question, the work takes a closer look at Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs. The study shows that the expert routers in MoE LLMs can serve as an off-the-shelf embedding model with promising performance on a diverse class of embedding-focused tasks, without requiring any finetuning. Moreover, extensive analysis shows that the MoE routing weights (RW) is complementary to the hidden state (HS) of LLMs, a widely-used embedding. Compared to HS, the study finds that RW is more robust to the choice of prompts and focuses on high-level semantics. Motivated by the analysis, the authors propose MoEE combining RW and HS, which achieves better performance than using either separately. The exploration of their combination and prompting strategy shed several novel insights, e.g., a weighted sum of RW and HS similarities outperforms the similarity on their concatenation. Experiments are conducted on 6 embedding tasks with 20 datasets from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). The results demonstrate the significant improvement brought by MoEE to LLM-based embedding without further finetuning. [Code is here](https://github.com/tianyi-lab/MoE-Embedding). <br> <br>

13. ***Inverse RL for LLM Training Goals:  <br>Imperial College London and Harvard explored Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to understand LLM reward functions. By reconstructing these functions, they improved model alignment with human preferences, achieving up to 80.40% accuracy on toxicity benchmarks.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 16, Imperial College London and Harvard Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12491) “Insights from the Inverse: Reconstructing LLM Training Goals Through Inverse RL”. Large language models (LLMs) trained with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their underlying reward functions and decision-making processes remain opaque. This paper introduces a novel approach to interpreting LLMs by applying inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to recover their implicit reward functions. The study conducts experiments on toxicity-aligned LLMs of varying sizes, extracting reward models that achieve up to 80.40% accuracy in predicting human preferences. The analysis reveals key insights into the non-identifiability of reward functions, the relationship between model size and interpretability, and potential pitfalls in the RLHF process. The study demonstrates that IRL-derived reward models can be used to fine-tune new LLMs, resulting in comparable or improved performance on toxicity benchmarks. This work provides a new lens for understanding and improving LLM alignment, with implications for the responsible development and deployment of these powerful systems. <br> <br>

15. ***Compressing LLM Weights with SeedLM:  <br>Apple and Meta introduced SeedLM, a compression technique for LLM weights using pseudo-random generator seeds. This method reduces memory and speeds up inference, retaining high accuracy even with heavily compressed models like Llama 3 70B.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 16, Apple and Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10714) “SeedLM: Compressing LLM Weights into Seeds of Pseudo-Random Generators”. Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, but face significant challenges in widespread deployment due to their high runtime cost. This study introduces SeedLM, a novel post-training compression method that uses seeds of pseudo-random generators to encode and compress model weights. Specifically, for each block of weights, the study finds a seed that is fed into a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) during inference to efficiently generate a random matrix. This matrix is then linearly combined with compressed coefficients to reconstruct the weight block. SeedLM reduces memory access and leverages idle compute cycles during inference, effectively speeding up memory-bound tasks by trading compute for fewer memory accesses. Unlike state-of-the-art compression methods that rely on calibration data, this approach is data-free and generalizes well across diverse tasks. Experiments with Llama 3 70B, which is particularly challenging to compress, show that SeedLM achieves significantly better zero-shot accuracy retention at 4- and 3-bit than state-of-the-art techniques, while maintaining performance comparable to FP16 baselines. Additionally, FPGA-based tests demonstrate that 4-bit SeedLM, as model size increases to 70B, approaches a 4x speed-up over an FP16 Llama 2/3 baseline. <br> <br>

17. ***Omni Context-Aware Transformer (OMCAT):  <br>Nvidia developed OMCAT, a model designed for cross-modal tasks involving audio and video streams. By leveraging Rotary Time Embeddings (RoTE) and a new dataset (OCTAV), OMCAT improved temporal reasoning and set a new standard for Audio-Visual Question Answering.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 15, Nvidia published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12109) “OMCAT: Omni Context Aware Transformer”. Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in text generation and comprehension, with recent advancements extending into multimodal LLMs that integrate visual and audio inputs. However, these models continue to struggle with fine-grained, cross-modal temporal understanding, particularly when correlating events across audio and video streams. The study addresses these challenges with two key contributions: a new dataset and model, called OCTAV and OMCAT respectively. OCTAV (Omni Context and Temporal Audio Video) is a novel dataset designed to capture event transitions across audio and video. Second, OMCAT (Omni Context Aware Transformer) is a powerful model that leverages RoTE (Rotary Time Embeddings), an innovative extension of RoPE, to enhance temporal grounding and computational efficiency in time-anchored tasks. Through a robust three-stage training pipeline-feature alignment, instruction tuning, and OCTAV-specific training-OMCAT excels in cross-modal temporal understanding. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) tasks and the OCTAV benchmark, showcasing significant gains in temporal reasoning and cross-modal alignment, as validated through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies. The dataset and code will be made publicly available. The link to the demo page is https://om-cat.github.io. <br> <br>

19. ***Continuous-Time Consistency Models:  <br>OpenAI simplified the training of Continuous-Time Consistency Models (CMs) by unifying previous diffusion model frameworks. Their new approach reduced instability during training and achieved state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with only two sampling steps.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 15, OpenAI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11081) “Simplifying, Stabilizing and Scaling Continuous-Time Consistency Models”. Consistency models (CMs) are a powerful class of diffusion-based generative models optimized for fast sampling. Most existing CMs are trained using discretized timesteps, which introduce additional hyperparameters and are prone to discretization errors. While continuous-time formulations can mitigate these issues, their success has been limited by training instability. To address this, the study proposes a simplified theoretical framework that unifies previous parameterizations of diffusion models and CMs, identifying the root causes of instability. Based on this analysis, the study introduces key improvements in diffusion process parameterization, network architecture, and training objectives. These changes enable to train continuous-time CMs at an unprecedented scale, reaching 1.5B parameters on ImageNet 512x512. The proposed training algorithm, using only two sampling steps, achieves FID scores of 2.06 on CIFAR-10, 1.48 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.88 on ImageNet 512x512, narrowing the gap in FID scores with the best existing diffusion models to within 10%. <br> <br>

21. ***First-Person Fairness in Chatbots:  <br>OpenAI introduced a scalable method for evaluating first-person fairness in chatbots, ensuring equal treatment regardless of user identity. The study identified bias patterns, such as gendered language, and showed that reinforcement learning could mitigate these biases.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 15, OpenAI published a [paper](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/first-person-fairness-in-chatbots.pdf) “First-Person Fairness in Chatbots”. Chatbots like ChatGPT are used by hundreds of millions of people for diverse purposes, ranging from resume writing to entertainment. These real-world applications are different from the institutional uses, such as resume screening or credit scoring, which have been the focus of much of AI research on bias and fairness. Ensuring equitable treatment for all users in these first-person contexts is critical. This work studies “first-person fairness,” which means fairness toward the user who is interacting with a chatbot. This includes providing high-quality responses to all users regardless of their identity or background, and avoiding harmful stereotypes. The work proposes a scalable, privacy-preserving method for evaluating one aspect of first-person fairness across a large, heterogeneous corpus of real-world chatbot interactions. Specifically, the work assesses potential bias linked to users’ names, which can serve as proxies for demographic attributes like gender or race, in chatbot systems such as ChatGPT, which provide mechanisms for storing and using user names. The method leverages a second language model to privately analyze name-sensitivity in the chatbot’s responses. The work verifies the validity of these annotations through independent human evaluation. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that post-training interventions, including reinforcement learning, significantly mitigate harmful stereotypes. The approach not only provides quantitative bias measurements but also yields succinct descriptions of subtle response differences across sixty-six distinct tasks. For instance, in the “writing a story” task, where the study observes the highest level of bias, chatbot responses show a tendency to create protagonists whose gender matches the likely gender inferred from the user’s name. Moreover, a general pattern emerges where users with female-associated names receive responses with friendlier and simpler language slightly more often on average than users with male-associated names. Finally, the study provides the system messages required for external researchers to replicate this work and further investigate ChatGPT’s behavior with hypothetical user profiles, fostering continued research on bias in chatbot interactions. <br> <br>

23. ***SimpleStrat for Diverse LLM Generation:  <br>UC Berkeley proposed SimpleStrat, a method for increasing the diversity of LLM-generated responses. Unlike traditional approaches using high temperatures, SimpleStrat stratifies response spaces, improving diversity while maintaining quality in tasks like planning and data generation.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 14, UC Berkeley published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.09038) “SimpleStrat: Diversifying Language Model Generation with Stratification”. Generating diverse responses from large language models (LLMs) is crucial for applications such as planning/search and synthetic data generation, where diversity provides distinct answers across generations. Prior approaches rely on increasing temperature to increase diversity. However, contrary to popular belief, the work shows not only does this approach produce lower quality individual generations as temperature increases, but it depends on model's next-token probabilities being similar to the true distribution of answers. The study proposes, an alternative approach that uses the language model itself to partition the space into strata. At inference, a random stratum is selected and a sample drawn from within the strata. To measure diversity, the study introduces CoverageQA, a dataset of underspecified questions with multiple equally plausible answers, and assess diversity by measuring KL Divergence between the output distribution and uniform distribution over valid ground truth answers. As computing probability per response/solution for proprietary models is infeasible, the measure recall on ground truth solutions. The evaluation show using SimpleStrat achieves higher recall by 0.05 compared to GPT-4o and 0.36 average reduction in KL Divergence compared to Llama 3. <br> <br>

25. ***LoLCATs for Linearizing LLMs:  <br>Stanford and MIT introduced LoLCATs, a method for linearizing LLMs with minimal memory and compute overhead. By using low-rank adaptation and attention transfer, they significantly improved the performance of linearized LLMs, scaling models up to 405B parameters.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 14, Stanford Uni, Together AI, California Inst of Tech and MIT published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10254) “LoLCATs: On Low-Rank Linearizing of Large Language Models”. Recent works show we can linearize large language models (LLMs) -- swapping the quadratic attentions of popular Transformer-based LLMs with subquadratic analogs, such as linear attention -- avoiding the expensive pretraining costs. However, linearizing LLMs often significantly degrades model quality, still requires training over billions of tokens, and remains limited to smaller 1.3B to 7B LLMs. The study thus proposes Low-rank Linear Conversion via Attention Transfer (LoLCATs), a simple two-step method that improves LLM linearizing quality with orders of magnitudes less memory and compute. The authors base these steps on two findings. First is to replace an LLM's softmax attentions with closely-approximating linear attentions, simply by training the linear attentions to match their softmax counterparts with an output MSE loss ("attention transfer"). Then, this enables adjusting for approximation errors and recovering LLM quality simply with low-rank adaptation (LoRA). LoLCATs significantly improves linearizing quality, training efficiency, and scalability. The study significantly reduces the linearizing quality gap and produce state-of-the-art subquadratic LLMs from Llama 3 8B and Mistral 7B v0.1, leading to 20+ points of improvement on 5-shot MMLU. Furthermore, LoLCATs does so with only 0.2% of past methods' model parameters and 0.4% of their training tokens. Finally, the authors apply LoLCATs to create the first linearized 70B and 405B LLMs (50x larger than prior work). When compared with prior approaches under the same compute budgets, LoLCATs significantly improves linearizing quality, closing the gap between linearized and original Llama 3.1 70B and 405B LLMs by 77.8% and 78.1% on 5-shot MMLU. <br> <br>

27. ***Thought-Like-Pro: Prolog-based Chain-of-Thought:  <br>Meta, UC Berkeley, and NYU developed Thought-Like-Pro, a method to enhance reasoning in LLMs using Prolog-based chain-of-thought. This approach improved LLM performance on complex tasks requiring reasoning and planning.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 14, Meta, UC Berkeley and NYU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10630) “Thought-Like-Pro: Enhancing Reasoning of Large Language Models through Self-Driven Prolog-based Chain-of-Thought”. LLMs are typically trained to answer user questions or follow instructions similarly to how human experts respond. However, in the standard alignment framework they lack the basic ability of explicit thinking before answering. Thinking is important for complex questions that require reasoning and planning -- but can be applied to any task. This study proposes a training method for equipping existing LLMs with such thinking abilities for general instruction following without use of additional human data. The study achieves this by an iterative search and optimization procedure that explores the space of possible thought generations, allowing the model to learn how to think without direct supervision. For each instruction, the thought candidates are scored using a judge model to evaluate their responses only, and then optimized via preference optimization. The work shows that this procedure leads to superior performance on AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard, and shows gains from thinking on non-reasoning categories such as marketing, health and general knowledge, in addition to more traditional reasoning & problem-solving tasks. <br> <br>

29. ***DuoAttention for Long-Context LLMs:  <br>MIT and Nvidia introduced DuoAttention, a framework for optimizing long-context LLMs by distinguishing between Retrieval and Streaming Heads. This reduced memory and latency while maintaining long-context capabilities, with applications in efficient LLM inference.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 14, MIT, Nvidia et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10819) “DuoAttention: Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference with Retrieval and Streaming Heads”. Deploying long-context large language models (LLMs) is essential but poses significant computational and memory challenges. Caching all Key and Value (KV) states across all attention heads consumes substantial memory. Existing KV cache pruning methods either damage the long-context capabilities of LLMs or offer only limited efficiency improvements. This paper identifies that only a fraction of attention heads, a.k.a, Retrieval Heads, are critical for processing long contexts and require full attention across all tokens. In contrast, all other heads, which primarily focus on recent tokens and attention sinks--referred to as Streaming Heads--do not require full attention. Based on this insight, the study introduces DuoAttention, a framework that only applies a full KV cache to retrieval heads while using a light-weight, constant-length KV cache for streaming heads, which reduces both LLM's decoding and pre-filling memory and latency without compromising its long-context abilities. DuoAttention uses a lightweight, optimization-based algorithm with synthetic data to identify retrieval heads accurately. The method significantly reduces long-context inference memory by up to 2.55x for MHA and 1.67x for GQA models while speeding up decoding by up to 2.18x and 1.50x and accelerating pre-filling by up to 1.73x and 1.63x for MHA and GQA models, respectively, with minimal accuracy loss compared to full attention. Notably, combined with quantization, DuoAttention enables Llama-3-8B decoding with 3.3 million context length on a single A100 GPU.

31. ***Context-Parametric Inversion: <br>
Large language models (LLMs) improve their ability to follow instructions through fine-tuning, but often struggle when input context conflicts with the model’s internal knowledge, leading to issues like hallucinations. The study reveals a phenomenon called "context-parametric inversion," where reliance on context initially improves with instruction fine-tuning but then decreases. This occurs when context overlaps with the model's existing knowledge, causing degradation. The study suggests mitigation strategies and aims to address this limitation in LLM training.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 14, CMU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10796) “Context-Parametric Inversion: Why Instruction Finetuning May Not Actually Improve Context Reliance”. Large language models are instruction-finetuned to enhance their ability to follow user instructions and process the input context. However, even state-of-the-art models often struggle to follow the instruction, especially when the input context is not aligned with the model's parametric knowledge. This manifests as various failures, such as hallucinations where the responses are outdated, biased or contain unverified facts. This work aims to understand the underlying reason for this poor context reliance, especially after instruction tuning. The work finds an intriguing phenomenon: during instruction tuning, the context reliance initially increases as expected, but then gradually decreases as instruction finetuning progresses. The authors call this phenomenon context-parametric inversion and observe it across multiple general purpose instruction tuning datasets like TULU, Alpaca and Ultrachat, as well as model families such as Llama, Mistral and Pythia. In a simple theoretical setup, the authors isolate why context-parametric inversion occurs along the gradient descent trajectory of instruction finetuning. The study ties this phenomena to examples in the instruction finetuning data mixture where the input context provides information that is already present in the model's parametric knowledge. The analysis suggests natural mitigation strategies that provide some limited gains, while also validating the theoretical insights. The authors hope that this work serves as a starting point in addressing this failure mode in a staple part of LLM training. <br> <br>

33. ***FLARE: Faithful Logic-Aided Reasoning and Exploration: <br>
A new approach called FLARE is introduced to improve the faithfulness of reasoning in LLMs used for question answering. Unlike existing methods that combine LLMs with external symbolic solvers, FLARE uses task decomposition and logic programming to maintain faithful reasoning steps without needing external tools. This method outperforms existing benchmarks and allows for more reliable reasoning processes in complex tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 14, Uni of Copenhagen, Uni of Edinburgh, Miniml.AI and Cohere published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11900) “FLARE: Faithful Logic-Aided Reasoning and Exploration”. Modern Question Answering (QA) and Reasoning approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) commonly use prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), assuming the resulting generation will have a more granular exploration and reasoning over the question space and scope. However, such methods struggle with generating outputs that are faithful to the intermediate chain of reasoning produced by the model. On the other end of the spectrum, neuro-symbolic methods such as Faithful CoT (F-CoT) propose to combine LLMs with external symbolic solvers. While such approaches boast a high degree of faithfulness, they usually require a model trained for code generation and struggle with tasks that are ambiguous or hard to formalise strictly. The study introduces Faithful Logic-Aided Reasoning and Exploration (FLARE), a novel interpretable approach for traversing the problem space using task decompositions. The authors use the LLM to plan a solution, soft-formalise the query into facts and predicates using a logic programming code and simulate that code execution using an exhaustive multi-hop search over the defined space. The method allows to compute the faithfulness of the reasoning process w.r.t. the generated code and analyse the steps of the multi-hop search without relying on external solvers. The methods achieve SOTA results on 7 out of 9 diverse reasoning benchmarks. The study also shows that model faithfulness positively correlates with overall performance and further demonstrate that FLARE allows pinpointing the decisive factors sufficient for and leading to the correct answer with optimal reasoning during the multi-hop search. <br> <br>

35. ***Thinking LLMs: <br>
This study proposes a new training method to teach LLMs to "think" before generating responses. Using an iterative optimization process, the model explores and refines potential thought patterns before answering questions, improving performance in areas like reasoning, marketing, and general knowledge. This approach enhances the model's ability to handle complex instructions without additional human data.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 14, Meta, UC Berkley, NYU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10630) “Thinking LLMs: General Instruction Following with Thought Generation”. LLMs are typically trained to answer user questions or follow instructions similarly to how human experts respond. However, in the standard alignment framework they lack the basic ability of explicit thinking before answering. Thinking is important for complex questions that require reasoning and planning -- but can be applied to any task.

37. ***MMCOMPOSITION: <br>
Researchers introduced MMCOMPOSITION, a benchmark for evaluating the compositionality of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This benchmark tests models’ ability to combine visual and textual elements, revealing limitations in current VLMs’ capacity to handle complex compositions. The study finds that GPT-4 falls short in compositionality compared to other open-source models, prompting recommendations for improving VLMs.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 13, Uni of Rochester, Apple, and Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.09733) “MMCOMPOSITION: Revisiting the Compositionality of Pre-trained Vision-Language Models”. The advent of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly advanced multimodal understanding, enabling more sophisticated and accurate integration of visual and textual information across various tasks, including image and video captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal retrieval. Despite VLMs' superior capabilities, researchers lack a comprehensive understanding of their compositionality -- the ability to understand and produce novel combinations of known visual and textual components. Prior benchmarks provide only a relatively rough compositionality evaluation from the perspectives of objects, relations, and attributes while neglecting deeper reasoning about object interactions, counting, and complex compositions. However, compositionality is a critical ability that facilitates coherent reasoning and understanding across modalities for VLMs. To address this limitation, the study proposes MMCOMPOSITION, a novel human-annotated benchmark for comprehensively and accurately evaluating VLMs' compositionality. The proposed benchmark serves as a complement to these earlier works. With MMCOMPOSITION, the study can quantify and explore the compositionality of the mainstream VLMs. Surprisingly, the work finds GPT-4o's compositionality inferior to the best open-source model, and the authors analyze the underlying reasons. Experimental analysis reveals the limitations of VLMs in fine-grained compositional perception and reasoning, and points to areas for improvement in VLM design and training.

39. ***ReLU’s Revival in LayerNorm-free Models: <br>
This study highlights issues with using GELU activation functions in LayerNorm-free language models, revealing that ReLU significantly outperforms GELU in these settings. ReLU’s geometric properties enhance learning dynamics, information retention, and overall model performance. The work offers insights for optimizing transformer architectures by avoiding entropic overload caused by smoother activations like GELU.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 13, NYU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.09637) “ReLU's Revival: On the Entropic Overload in Normalization-Free Large Language Models”. LayerNorm is a critical component in modern large language models (LLMs) for stabilizing training and ensuring smooth optimization. However, it introduces significant challenges in mechanistic interpretability, outlier feature suppression, faithful signal propagation, and computational and communication complexity of private inference. This work explores desirable activation functions in normalization-free decoder-only LLMs. Contrary to the conventional preference for the GELU in transformer-based models, empirical findings demonstrate an opposite trend— ReLU significantly outperforms GELU in LayerNorm-free models, leading to an 8.2% perplexity improvement. The work discovers a key issue with GELU, where early layers experience entropic overload, leading to the under-utilization of the representational capacity of attention heads. This highlights that smoother activations like GELU are ill-suited for LayerNorm-free architectures, whereas ReLU’s geometrical properties—specialization in input space and intra-class selectivity—lead to improved learning dynamics and better information retention in the absence of LayerNorm. This study offers key insights for optimizing transformer architectures where LayerNorm introduces significant challenges. <br> <br>

41. ***Taming Overconfidence in LLMs: <br>
This paper examines the overconfidence problem in LLMs fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). It introduces two Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) variants—PPO-M and PPO-C—that reduce overconfidence by adjusting reward calculations. These methods are shown to lower calibration error without compromising model performance across diverse datasets.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 13, CMU, UC Berkeley et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.09724) “Taming Overconfidence in LLMs: Reward Calibration in RLHF”. Language model calibration refers to the alignment between the confidence of the model and the actual performance of its responses. While previous studies point out the overconfidence phenomenon in Large Language Models (LLMs) and show that LLMs trained with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are overconfident with a more sharpened output probability, this study reveals that RLHF tends to lead models to express verbalized overconfidence in their own responses. The study investigates the underlying cause of this overconfidence and demonstrate that reward models used for Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) exhibit inherent biases towards high-confidence scores regardless of the actual quality of responses. Building upon this insight, the work proposes two PPO variants: PPO-M: PPO with Calibrated Reward Modeling and PPO-C: PPO with Calibrated Reward Calculation. PPO-M integrates explicit confidence scores in reward model training, which calibrates reward models to better capture the alignment between response quality and verbalized confidence. PPO-C adjusts the reward score during PPO based on the difference between the current reward and the moving average of past rewards. Both PPO-M and PPO-C can be seamlessly integrated into the current PPO pipeline and do not require additional golden labels. The study evaluates the methods on both Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B across six diverse datasets including multiple-choice and open-ended generation. Experiment results demonstrate that both of the methods can reduce calibration error and maintain performance comparable to standard PPO. The study further shows that they do not compromise model capabilities in open-ended conversation settings. <br> <br>

43. ***ALLoRA: Adaptive Learning Rate in LoRA Finetuning: <br>
ALLoRA improves upon the existing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method for LLM finetuning by addressing limitations related to Dropout and scaling factors in short training episodes. By introducing adaptive learning rates, ALLoRA achieves better performance and efficiency, eliminating the need for certain hyperparameters. This approach shows significant accuracy gains over LoRA and its variants.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 13, Google and Brown Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.09692) “ALLoRA: Adaptive Learning Rate Mitigates LoRA Fatal Flaws”. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is the bread and butter of Large Language Model (LLM) finetuning. LoRA learns an additive low-rank perturbation, AB, of a pretrained matrix parameter W to align the model to a new task or dataset with W+AB. The study identifies three core limitations to LoRA for finetuning--a setting that employs limited amount of data and training steps. First, LoRA employs Dropout to prevent overfitting. The work proves that Dropout is only suitable for long training episodes but fails to converge to a reliable regularizer for short training episodes. Second, LoRA's initialization of B at 0 creates a slow training dynamic between A and B. That dynamic is also exacerbated by Dropout that further slows the escape from 0 for B which is particularly harmful for short training episodes. Third, the scaling factor multiplying each LoRA additive perturbation creates “short-sighted'” interactions between the LoRA modules of different layers. Motivated by principled analysis of those limitations, the study proposes an elegant solution: a Dropout-free, scaling-free, LoRA with Adaptive Learning rate--coined ALLoRA. By scaling the per sample and per parameter gradients with a coefficient inversely proportional to parameters' ℓ2 norm, ALLoRA alleviates those three limitations. As a by-product, ALLoRA removes two hyper-parameters from LoRA: the scaling factor and the dropout rate. Empirical results show that ALLoRA admits better accuracy than LoRA on various settings, including against recent LoRA variants such as Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA). Ablation studies show the solution is the optimal in a family of weight-dependent / output-dependent approaches on various LLMs including the latest Llama3. <br> <br>

45. ***Controllable Safety Alignment: <br>
This paper introduces a flexible framework, Controllable Safety Alignment (CoSA), for adapting LLMs to diverse safety requirements at inference time without retraining. Users can modify safety configurations using natural language prompts, allowing models to align with different cultural and social norms. CoSAlign improves model controllability and practicality, addressing the limitations of static safety standards.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 11, Microsoft and Johns Hopkins Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08968) “Controllable Safety Alignment: Inference-Time Adaptation to Diverse Safety Requirements”. The current paradigm for safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) follows a one-size-fits-all approach: the model refuses to interact with any content deemed unsafe by the model provider. This approach lacks flexibility in the face of varying social norms across cultures and regions. In addition, users may have diverse safety needs, making a model with static safety standards too restrictive to be useful, as well as too costly to be re-aligned. The work proposes Controllable Safety Alignment (CoSA), a framework designed to adapt models to diverse safety requirements without re-training. Instead of aligning a fixed model, the work aligns models to follow safety configs -- free-form natural language descriptions of the desired safety behaviors -- that are provided as part of the system prompt. To adjust model safety behavior, authorized users only need to modify such safety configs at inference time. To enable that, the work proposes CoSAlign, a data-centric method for aligning LLMs to easily adapt to diverse safety configs. Furthermore, the study devises a novel controllability evaluation protocol that considers both helpfulness and configured safety, summarizing them into CoSA-Score, and construct CoSApien, a human-authored benchmark that consists of real-world LLM use cases with diverse safety requirements and corresponding evaluation prompts. The study shows that CoSAlign leads to substantial gains of controllability over strong baselines including in-context alignment. The framework encourages better representation and adaptation to pluralistic human values in LLMs, and thereby increasing their practicality. <br> <br>

47. ***MiRAGeNews: AI-Generated News Detection: <br>
The study presents the MiRAGeNews Dataset, designed to detect AI-generated fake news by analyzing image-caption pairs. The dataset poses a significant challenge for both humans and multi-modal LLMs. The authors propose a multi-modal detector, MiRAGe, that improves detection accuracy and helps combat the spread of misleading AI-generated content.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 11, Uni of Pennsylvania published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.09045) “MiRAGeNews: Multimodal Realistic AI-Generated News Detection”. The proliferation of inflammatory or misleading "fake" news content has become increasingly common in recent years. Simultaneously, it has become easier than ever to use AI tools to generate photorealistic images depicting any scene imaginable. Combining these two -- AI-generated fake news content -- is particularly potent and dangerous. To combat the spread of AI-generated fake news, the work proposes the MiRAGeNews Dataset, a dataset of 12,500 high-quality real and AI-generated image-caption pairs from state-of-the-art generators. The study finds that the dataset poses a significant challenge to humans (60% F-1) and state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs (< 24% F-1). Using the dataset the authors train a multi-modal detector (MiRAGe) that improves by +5.1% F-1 over state-of-the-art baselines on image-caption pairs from out-of-domain image generators and news publishers. The authors release the code and data to aid future work on detecting AI-generated content. <br> <br>

49. ***Agents Thinking Fast and Slow: <br>
Inspired by Kahneman's "Thinking Fast and Slow," this study proposes a dual-agent architecture for LLMs. A "Talker" agent handles quick, intuitive conversational responses, while a "Reasoner" agent deals with more complex multi-step reasoning and planning tasks. This modular system improves interaction by balancing speed and logical precision, demonstrated through a sleep-coaching agent.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 10, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08328)  “Agents Thinking Fast and Slow: A Talker-Reasoner Architecture”. Large language models have enabled agents of all kinds to interact with users through natural conversation. Consequently, agents now have two jobs: conversing and planning/reasoning. Their conversational responses must be informed by all available information, and their actions must help to achieve goals. This dichotomy between conversing with the user and doing multi-step reasoning and planning can be seen as analogous to the human systems of "thinking fast and slow" as introduced by Kahneman. The proposed approach is comprised of a "Talker" agent (System 1) that is fast and intuitive, and tasked with synthesizing the conversational response; and a "Reasoner" agent (System 2) that is slower, more deliberative, and more logical, and is tasked with multi-step reasoning and planning, calling tools, performing actions in the world, and thereby producing the new agent state. The study describes the new Talker-Reasoner architecture and discuss its advantages, including modularity and decreased latency. The authors ground the discussion in the context of a sleep coaching agent, in order to demonstrate real-world relevance. <br> <br>

51. ***KV Prediction for Faster Inference: <br>
The paper introduces KV Prediction, a method to reduce the time taken for LLMs to generate their first token during inference. By using an auxiliary model to approximate the KV cache, the method significantly improves efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. This approach is especially useful for edge devices and demonstrates improvements in various benchmarks.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 10, Apple published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08391) “KV Prediction for Improved Time to First Token”. Inference with transformer-based language models begins with a prompt processing step. In this step, the model generates the first output token and stores the KV cache needed for future generation steps. This prompt processing step can be computationally expensive, taking 10s of seconds or more for billion-parameter models on edge devices when prompt lengths or batch sizes rise. This degrades user experience by introducing significant latency into the model's outputs. To reduce the time spent producing the first output (known as the “time to first token”, or TTFT) of a pretrained model, the study introduces a novel method called KV Prediction. In this method, a small auxiliary model is used to process the prompt and produce an approximation of the KV cache used by a base model. This approximated KV cache is then used with the base model for autoregressive generation without the need to query the auxiliary model again. The study demonstrates that the method produces a pareto-optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-off when compared to baselines. On TriviaQA, the study demonstrates relative accuracy improvements in the range of 15%-50% across a range of TTFT FLOPs budgets. The work also demonstrates accuracy improvements of up to 30% on HumanEval python code completion at fixed TTFT FLOPs budgets. Additionally, the authors benchmark models on an Apple M2 Pro CPU and demonstrate that the improvement in FLOPs translates to a TTFT speedup on hardware. The authors release our code at https://github.com/apple/corenet/tree/main/projects/kv-prediction. <br> <br>

53. ***GenARM: Autoregressive Reward Model for Test-time Alignment: <br>
GenARM proposes a test-time alignment method using an Autoregressive Reward Model to guide frozen LLMs. Unlike previous methods, it can compute next-token rewards, making it more suitable for autoregressive text generation. The approach achieves comparable performance to traditional methods while allowing multi-objective alignment and efficient preference guidance without retraining.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 10, Uni Maryland and JPMorgan AI Research published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08193) “GenARM: Reward Guided Generation with Autoregressive Reward Model for Test-time Alignment”. Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but require careful alignment with human preferences. Traditional training-time methods finetune LLMs using human preference datasets but incur significant training costs and require repeated training to handle diverse user preferences. Test-time alignment methods address this by using reward models (RMs) to guide frozen LLMs without retraining. However, existing test-time approaches rely on trajectory-level RMs which are designed to evaluate complete responses, making them unsuitable for autoregressive text generation that requires computing next-token rewards from partial responses. To address this, the study introduces GenARM, a test-time alignment approach that leverages the Autoregressive Reward Model--a novel reward parametrization designed to predict next-token rewards for efficient and effective autoregressive generation. Theoretically, the work demonstrates that this parametrization can provably guide frozen LLMs toward any distribution achievable by traditional RMs within the KL-regularized reinforcement learning framework. Experimental results show that GenARM significantly outperforms prior test-time alignment baselines and matches the performance of training-time methods. Additionally, GenARM enables efficient weak-to-strong guidance, aligning larger LLMs with smaller RMs without the high costs of training larger models. Furthermore, GenARM supports multi-objective alignment, allowing real-time trade-offs between preference dimensions and catering to diverse user preferences without retraining. <br> <br>

55. ***Long-Context LLMs and RAG: <br>
The study explores the limitations of using long-context LLMs for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It identifies the negative impact of retrieved "hard negatives" on performance as context length increases. The authors propose training-free and training-based optimizations to enhance RAG effectiveness in long-context scenarios, achieving notable improvements in robustness and performance.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 8, Google and UIUC published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05983) “Long-Context LLMs Meet RAG”. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) empowers large language models (LLMs) to utilize external knowledge sources. The increasing capacity of LLMs to process longer input sequences opens up avenues for providing more retrieved information, to potentially enhance the quality of generated outputs. It is plausible to assume that a larger retrieval set would contain more relevant information (higher recall), that might result in improved performance. However, empirical findings demonstrate that for many long-context LLMs, the quality of generated output initially improves first, but then subsequently declines as the number of retrieved passages increases. This paper investigates this phenomenon, identifying the detrimental impact of retrieved "hard negatives" as a key contributor. To mitigate this and enhance the robustness of long-context LLM-based RAG, the study proposes both training-free and training-based approaches. The work first showcases the effectiveness of retrieval reordering as a simple yet powerful training-free optimization. Furthermore, the work explores training-based methods, specifically RAG-specific implicit LLM fine-tuning and RAG-oriented fine-tuning with intermediate reasoning, demonstrating their capacity for substantial performance gains. Finally, the study conducts a systematic analysis of design choices for these training-based methods, including data distribution, retriever selection, and training context length. <br> <br>

57. ***GSM-Symbolic: Limitations in Mathematical Reasoning: <br>
This study examines the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs using a new benchmark called GSM-Symbolic. It reveals that LLMs struggle with consistent performance when minor variations are made to question templates, particularly in multi-clause problems. The findings suggest that current models replicate reasoning patterns from training data, rather than performing genuine logical reasoning, highlighting areas for improvement.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 7, Apple published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05229) “GSM-Symbolic: Understanding the Limitations of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models”. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their formal reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematics. The GSM8K benchmark is widely used to assess the mathematical reasoning of models on grade-school-level questions. While the performance of LLMs on GSM8K has significantly improved in recent years, it remains unclear whether their mathematical reasoning capabilities have genuinely advanced, raising questions about the reliability of the reported metrics. To address these concerns, the work conducts a large-scale study on several SOTA open and closed models. To overcome the limitations of existing evaluations, the work introduces GSM-Symbolic, an improved benchmark created from symbolic templates that allow for the generation of a diverse set of questions. GSM-Symbolic enables more controllable evaluations, providing key insights and more reliable metrics for measuring the reasoning capabilities of this http URL findings reveal that LLMs exhibit noticeable variance when responding to different instantiations of the same question. Specifically, the performance of all models declines when only the numerical values in the question are altered in the GSM-Symbolic benchmark. Furthermore, the study investigates the fragility of mathematical reasoning in these models and show that their performance significantly deteriorates as the number of clauses in a question increases. The authors hypothesize that this decline is because current LLMs cannot perform genuine logical reasoning; they replicate reasoning steps from their training data. Adding a single clause that seems relevant to the question causes significant performance drops (up to 65%) across all state-of-the-art models, even though the clause doesn't contribute to the reasoning chain needed for the final answer. Overall, the work offers a more nuanced understanding of LLMs' capabilities and limitations in mathematical reasoning.

1. ***Improving reasoning in LLMs with PRMs:  <br>Google and CMU explore process reward models (PRMs) to enhance reasoning in large language models (LLMs). PRMs offer feedback at each reasoning step, unlike outcome reward models (ORMs), which only provide final feedback. The key is measuring progress at each step via a distinct prover policy. They find weak provers can improve stronger base policies, boosting accuracy and efficiency by over 6%, and enabling gains in reinforcement learning (RL).*** <br> <br>
   Oct 11, Google and CMU published a [paper](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2410.08146#:~:text=A%20promising%20approach%20for%20improving,feedback%20at%20the%20final%20step.) “Rewarding Progress: Scaling Automated Process Verifiers for LLM Reasoning”. A promising approach for improving reasoning in large language models is to use process reward models (PRMs). PRMs provide feedback at each step of a multi-step reasoning trace, potentially improving credit assignment over outcome reward models (ORMs) that only provide feedback at the final step. However, collecting dense, per-step human labels is not scalable, and training PRMs from automatically-labeled data has thus far led to limited gains. To improve a base policy by running search against a PRM or using it as dense rewards for reinforcement learning (RL), the study asks: “How should we design process rewards?”. The key insight is that, to be effective, the process reward for a step should measure progress: a change in the likelihood of producing a correct response in the future, before and after taking the step, corresponding to the notion of step-level advantages in RL. Crucially, this progress should be measured under a prover policy distinct from the base policy. The work theoretically characterize the set of good provers and the results show that optimizing process rewards from such provers improves exploration during test-time search and online RL. In fact, the characterization shows that weak prover policies can substantially improve a stronger base policy, which the authors also observe empirically. The work validates the claims by training process advantage verifiers (PAVs) to predict progress under such provers, and show that compared to ORMs, test-time search against PAVs is > 8% more accurate, and 1.5 − 5× more compute-efficient. Online RL with dense rewards from PAVs enables one of the first results with 5 − 6× gain in sample efficiency, and > 6% gain in accuracy, over ORMs. <br> <br>

3. ***Nobel Prize 2024 in AI and Physics:  <br>John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics for their groundbreaking work in machine learning. Their inventions fueled the AI revolution, with Hinton famously warning about the risks of advanced AI. The award coincides with another Nobel Prize in Chemistry for AI-related breakthroughs in protein design, highlighting AI’s growing influence across scientific fields.*** <br> <br>
   Oct 10, [according to Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/science/hopfield-hinton-win-2024-nobel-prize-physics-2024-10-08/?utm_source=neuralfrontier.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=meta-teases-a-new-video-model&_bhlid=eff04f5277f7d09ad170836c27d4f4b3e57f5868#:~:text=STOCKHOLM%2C%20Oct%208%20(Reuters),for%20the%20artificial%20intelligence%20boom.), “Nobel physics prize 2024 won by AI pioneers John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton”. U.S. scientist John Hopfield and British-Canadian Geoffrey Hinton won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday for discoveries and inventions in machine learning that paved the way for the artificial intelligence boom. Heralded for its revolutionary potential in areas ranging from cutting-edge scientific discovery to more efficient admin, the emerging technology on which the duo worked has also raised fears humankind may soon be outsmarted and outcompeted by its own creation. Hinton has been widely credited as a godfather of AI and made headlines when he quit his job at Google (GOOGL.O), opens new tab last year to be able to more easily speak about the dangers of the technology he had pioneered. Hopfield, 91, a professor emeritus at Princeton University, created an associative memory that can store and reconstruct images and other types of patterns in data. He echoed Hinton's concerns, saying there was something unnerving about the unknown potential and limits of AI. One day after the physics prize was announced, Demis Hassabis, John Jumper, and David Baker won the Chemistry Nobel Prize for their work on AlphaFold and protein design. AlphaFold and AlphaFold 2, as well as the work of Baker’s lab, are compelling applications of AI that made significant steps forward in chemistry and biology, and this award, too, is well deserved! It’s remarkable that the Nobel committees for physics and chemistry, which are made up of scientists in those fields, chose to honor AI researchers with this year’s awards.  <br> <br>

5. ***State of AI Report:  <br>This report examines five AI dimensions: research, industry, politics, safety, and predictions. OpenAI leads in research, NVIDIA dominates the industry, and AI’s political impact is yet to unfold. Companies are shifting focus from safety to sales. Predictions include a rise in viral AI apps and open-source alternatives to dominant models, while investment in humanoids may decline.*** <br> <br>
   Oct 10, Stateof.ai and airstreet.com [published](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GmZmoWOa2O92BPrncRcTKa15xvQGhq7g4I4hJSNlC0M/edit#slide=id.g309a25a756d_0_85) “State of AI Report”.  The report considered five key dimensions. Research – Frontier lab performance converges, but OpenAI maintains its edge following the launch of o1, as planning and reasoning emerge as a major frontier. Foundation models demonstrate their ability to break out of language as multimodal research drives into mathematics, biology, genomics, the physical sciences, and neuroscience. Industry - NVIDIA remains the most powerful company in the world, enjoying a stint in the $3T club, while regulators probe the concentrations of power within GenAI. More established GenAI companies bring in billions of dollars in revenue, while start-ups begin to gain traction in sectors like video and audio generation. Although companies begin to make the journey from model to product, long-term questions around pricing and sustainability remain unresolved. Driven by a bull run in public markets, AI companies reach $9T in value, while investment levels grow healthily in private companies. Politics - Anticipated AI effects on elections, employment and a range of other sensitive areas are yet to be realized at any scale. Safety - A vibe-shift from safety to acceleration takes place as companies that previously warned us about the pending extinction of humanity need to ramp up enterprise sales and usage of their consumer apps. Every proposed jailbreaking ‘fix’ has failed, but researchers are increasingly concerned with more sophisticated, long-term attacks. Predictions - An app or website created solely by someone with no coding ability will go viral (e.g. App Store Top-100). Frontier labs implement meaningful changes to data collection practices after cases begin reaching trial. An open source alternative to OpenAI o1 surpasses it across a range of reasoning benchmarks. Levels of investment in humanoids will trail off, as companies struggle to achieve product-market fit. <br> <br>
 
7. ***Nvidia’s Mixture of Experts (MoE) Models:  <br>Nvidia introduces methods to convert pre-trained dense models into sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, increasing capacity without retraining from scratch. Their new initialization and routing techniques outperform dense models, with upcycled models achieving higher accuracy and efficiency, particularly in massive language tasks.*** <br> <br>
   Oct 10, Nvidia published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07524) “Upcycling Large Language Models into Mixture of Experts”. Upcycling pre-trained dense language models into sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) models is an efficient approach to increase the model capacity of already trained models. However, optimal techniques for upcycling at scale remain unclear. In this work, the authors conduct an extensive study of upcycling methods and hyperparameters for billion-parameter scale language models. The work proposes a novel "virtual group" initialization scheme and weight scaling approach to enable upcycling into fine-grained MoE architectures. Through ablations, the work finds that upcycling outperforms continued dense model training. In addition, the study shows that softmax-then-topK expert routing improves over topK-then-softmax approach and higher granularity MoEs can help improve accuracy. Finally, the work upcycled Nemotron-4 15B on 1T tokens and compared it to a continuously trained version of the same model on the same 1T tokens: the continuous trained model achieved 65.3% MMLU, whereas the upcycled model achieved 67.6%. The results offer insights and best practices to effectively leverage upcycling for building MoE language models. <br> <br>

9. ***Autoregressive Video Diffusion Models:  <br>Stony Brook University and Adobe extend video diffusion models to generate longer videos by progressively denoising latent frames. This technique allows the generation of high-quality, 1-minute videos without scene disruptions. The new models achieve state-of-the-art results in long video generation, overcoming previous limitations.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 10, Stony Brook Uni and Adobe published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08151) “Progressive Autoregressive Video Diffusion Models”. Current frontier video diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable results at generating high-quality videos. However, they can only generate short video clips, normally around 10 seconds or 240 frames, due to computation limitations during training. This work shows that existing models can be naturally extended to autoregressive video diffusion models without changing the architectures. The key idea is to assign the latent frames with progressively increasing noise levels rather than a single noise level, which allows for fine-grained condition among the latents and large overlaps between the attention windows. Such progressive video denoising allows the models to autoregressively generate video frames without quality degradation or abrupt scene changes. The paper presents state-of-the-art results on long video generation at 1 minute (1440 frames at 24 FPS). Videos from this paper are available at https://desaixie.github.io/pa-vdm/. <br> <br>

11. ***Agent S: Automating GUI Tasks:  <br>Agent S, developed by Simular Research, introduces a framework for autonomous computer interactions via GUI, solving complex tasks using hierarchical planning. It outperforms existing models in task success rates and shows broad generalizability across systems. The framework represents a significant step forward in human-computer interaction automation.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 10, Simular Research published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08164) “Agent S: An Open Agentic Framework that Uses Computers Like a Human”. The paper presents Agent S, an open agentic framework that enables autonomous interaction with computers through a Graphical User Interface (GUI), aimed at transforming human-computer interaction by automating complex, multi-step tasks. Agent S aims to address three key challenges in automating computer tasks: acquiring domain-specific knowledge, planning over long task horizons, and handling dynamic, non-uniform interfaces. To this end, Agent S introduces experience-augmented hierarchical planning, which learns from external knowledge search and internal experience retrieval at multiple levels, facilitating efficient task planning and subtask execution. In addition, it employs an Agent-Computer Interface (ACI) to better elicit the reasoning and control capabilities of GUI agents based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Evaluation on the OSWorld benchmark shows that Agent S outperforms the baseline by 9.37% on success rate (an 83.6% relative improvement) and achieves a new state-of-the-art. Comprehensive analysis highlights the effectiveness of individual components and provides insights for future improvements. Furthermore, Agent S demonstrates broad generalizability to different operating systems on a newly-released WindowsAgentArena benchmark.

13. ***Agentic Reasoning Era in AI:  <br>An article from Sequoia highlights the shift from pattern-based AI to agentic reasoning. This evolution allows AI to deliberate before responding, enhancing problem-solving capabilities. AI is moving towards performing work across various sectors, suggesting future AI applications will revolutionize service industries.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 9, Seauoia published an [article](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ais-act-o1/) “Generative AI’s Act o1 - The Agentic Reasoning Era Begins”. The article discusses the ongoing evolution of Generative AI from rapid, pattern-based responses ("System 1") to deeper, deliberate reasoning ("System 2"). It highlights that the market for large language models (LLMs) has stabilized among major players (Microsoft/OpenAI, AWS/Anthropic, Google/DeepMind). However, the next frontier is enhancing AI's reasoning abilities at inference time, enabling AI to "stop and think" before responding, akin to the reasoning used by AlphaGo in its famous 2016 Go match. The new "Strawberry" model from OpenAI is the first to implement this, leveraging "inference-time compute" for more thoughtful problem-solving, especially in structured domains like math and coding. This shift introduces a new scaling law: more inference-time compute leads to better reasoning, potentially enabling AI to solve increasingly complex problems, from programming to mathematics. In terms of applications, a new wave of agentic applications is emerging, powered by this advanced reasoning layer. These applications move beyond mere automation, targeting specific tasks in various sectors, from legal work (Harvey) to cybersecurity (XBOW) and software engineering (Factory). The essay argues that AI is shifting from selling software to selling "work," expanding into trillion-dollar service markets. The article concludes with a focus on the potential of multi-agent systems, where AI agents collaborate to achieve more complex goals, signaling the next phase of AI development and hinting at the emergence of true AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). <br> <br>

15. ***Repetition vs. Data Diversity in Transformers:  <br>Meta explores how repeated training examples improve transformers' performance over diverse data in mathematical tasks. Their findings suggest that repetition can accelerate learning and performance in structured tasks like math, providing insights into balancing generalization and memorization in deep learning.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 9, Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07041) “Emergent properties with repeated examples”. The work studies the performance of transformers as a function of the number of repetitions of training examples with algorithmically generated datasets. On three problems of mathematics: the greatest common divisor, modular multiplication, and matrix eigenvalues, the work shows that for a fixed number of training steps, models trained on smaller sets of repeated examples outperform models trained on larger sets of single-use examples. The work also demonstrates that two-set training - repeated use of a small random subset of examples, along normal sampling on the rest of the training set - provides for faster learning and better performance. This highlights that the benefits of repetition can outweigh those of data diversity. These datasets and problems provide a controlled setting to shed light on the still poorly understood interplay between generalization and memorization in deep learning. <br> <br>

17. ***Pixtral-12B Multimodal Language Model:  <br> <br>Mistral introduces Pixtral-12B, a highly efficient multimodal language model outperforming larger counterparts on image and document understanding benchmarks. It excels without compromising natural language processing capabilities, and its ability to process multiple images in long contexts sets it apart from other models.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 9, Mistral published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07073) “Pixtral 12B”. The paper introduces Pixtral-12B, a 12--billion-parameter multimodal language model. Pixtral-12B is trained to understand both natural images and documents, achieving leading performance on various multimodal benchmarks, surpassing a number of larger models. Unlike many open-source models, Pixtral is also a cutting-edge text model for its size, and does not compromise on natural language performance to excel in multimodal tasks. Pixtral uses a new vision encoder trained from scratch, which allows it to ingest images at their natural resolution and aspect ratio. This gives users flexibility on the number of tokens used to process an image. Pixtral is also able to process any number of images in its long context window of 128K tokens. Pixtral 12B substanially outperforms other open models of similar sizes (Llama-3.2 11B \& Qwen-2-VL 7B). It also outperforms much larger open models like Llama-3.2 90B while being 7x smaller. We further contribute an open-source benchmark, MM-MT-Bench, for evaluating vision-language models in practical scenarios, and provide detailed analysis and code for standardized evaluation protocols for multimodal LLMs. Pixtral-12B is released under Apache 2.0 license. <br> <br>

19. ***MLE-Bench for Machine Learning Engineering:  <br> <br>OpenAI introduces MLE-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate AI agents' machine learning engineering skills across 75 tasks. The study demonstrates AI's ability to match human performance in some competitions, although resource scaling and contamination from pre-training remain challenges.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 9, OpenAI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07095) “MLE-bench: Evaluating Machine Learning Agents on Machine Learning Engineering”. The paper introduces MLE-bench, a benchmark for measuring how well AI agents perform at machine learning engineering. To this end, the study curates 75 ML engineering-related competitions from Kaggle, creating a diverse set of challenging tasks that test real-world ML engineering skills such as training models, preparing datasets, and running experiments. The study establishes human baselines for each competition using Kaggle's publicly available leaderboards. The work uses open-source agent scaffolds to evaluate several frontier language models on the benchmark, finding that the best-performing setup--OpenAI's o1-preview with AIDE scaffolding--achieves at least the level of a Kaggle bronze medal in 16.9% of competitions. In addition to the main results, the study investigates various forms of resource scaling for AI agents and the impact of contamination from pre-training. OpenAI open-source the benchmark code (github.com/openai/mle-bench/) to facilitate future research in understanding the ML engineering capabilities of AI agents. <br> <br>

21. ***Human-AI Complementarity in QA:  <br>A study investigates AI and human performance in question-answering tasks, revealing that humans outperform AI in abductive reasoning, while AI excels in fact-based retrieval. The findings emphasize the need for QA tasks that push AI towards higher-order reasoning and nuanced understanding.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 9, Uni of Maryland and Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06524) “Do great minds think alike? Investigating Human-AI Complementarity in Question Answering with CAIMIRA”. Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) have led to claims of AI surpassing humans in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as textual understanding and reasoning. This work investigates these assertions by introducing CAIMIRA, a novel framework rooted in item response theory (IRT) that enables quantitative assessment and comparison of problem-solving abilities of question-answering (QA) agents: humans and AI systems. Through analysis of over 300,000 responses from ~70 AI systems and 155 humans across thousands of quiz questions, CAIMIRA uncovers distinct proficiency patterns in knowledge domains and reasoning skills. Humans outperform AI systems in knowledge-grounded abductive and conceptual reasoning, while state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 and LLaMA show superior performance on targeted information retrieval and fact-based reasoning, particularly when information gaps are well-defined and addressable through pattern matching or data retrieval. These findings highlight the need for future QA tasks to focus on questions that challenge not only higher-order reasoning and scientific thinking, but also demand nuanced linguistic interpretation and cross-contextual knowledge application, helping advance AI developments that better emulate or complement human cognitive abilities in real-world problem-solving. <br> <br>

23. ***Cheating in Automatic LLM Benchmarks:  <br>Research reveals that LLM benchmarks can be gamed by null models that produce irrelevant outputs but still achieve high win rates. This highlights the need for better anti-cheating mechanisms to maintain the reliability of AI evaluations.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 9, Sea AI Lab and Singapore Management Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07137) “Cheating Automatic LLM Benchmarks: Null Models Achieve High Win Rates”. Automatic LLM benchmarks, such as AlpacaEval 2.0, Arena-Hard-Auto, and MT-Bench, have become popular for evaluating language models due to their cost-effectiveness and scalability compared to human evaluation. Achieving high win rates on these benchmarks can significantly boost the promotional impact of newly released language models. This promotional benefit may motivate tricks, such as manipulating model output length or style to game win rates, even though several mechanisms have been developed to control length and disentangle style to reduce gameability. Nonetheless, the study shows that even a "null model" that always outputs a constant response (irrelevant to input instructions) can cheat automatic benchmarks and achieve top-ranked win rates: an 86.5% LC win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0; an 83.0 score on Arena-Hard-Auto; and a 9.55 score on MT-Bench. Moreover, the crafted cheating outputs are transferable because the authors assume that the instructions of these benchmarks (e.g., 805 samples of AlpacaEval 2.0) are private and cannot be accessed. While the experiments are primarily proof-of-concept, an adversary could use LLMs to generate more imperceptible cheating responses, unethically benefiting from high win rates and promotional impact. The findings call for the development of anti-cheating mechanisms for reliable automatic benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Cheating-LLM-Benchmarks. <br> <br>

25. ***Retrieval-Augmented Decision Transformer:  <br>A new method for reinforcement learning, RA-DT uses external memory to store and retrieve relevant past experiences, improving decision-making in complex environments. This innovation addresses the limitations of in-context learning in reinforcement learning, particularly in long, sparse-reward tasks.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 9, JKU Liz, Extensity AI, Google, UCL et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07071) “Retrieval-Augmented Decision Transformer: External Memory for In-context RL”. In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a model to learn a new task by observing a few exemplars in its context. While prevalent in NLP, this capability has recently also been observed in Reinforcement Learning (RL) settings. Prior in-context RL methods, however, require entire episodes in the agent's context. Given that complex environments typically lead to long episodes with sparse rewards, these methods are constrained to simple environments with short episodes. To address these challenges, the study introduces Retrieval-Augmented Decision Transformer (RA-DT). RA-DT employs an external memory mechanism to store past experiences from which it retrieves only sub-trajectories relevant for the current situation. The retrieval component in RA-DT does not require training and can be entirely domain-agnostic. The work evaluates the capabilities of RA-DT on grid-world environments, robotics simulations, and procedurally-generated video games. On grid-worlds, RA-DT outperforms baselines, while using only a fraction of their context length. Furthermore, the study illuminates the limitations of current in-context RL methods on complex environments and discuss future directions. To facilitate future research, the authors release datasets for four of the considered environments. <br> <br>

27. ***LLMs Performing Multiple Tasks Simultaneously:  <br>A surprising discovery shows LLMs can perform multiple distinct tasks simultaneously during a single inference call. This "task superposition" capability highlights the latent potential of LLMs and raises new questions about the underlying mechanisms enabling such versatility.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 8, Uni of Wisconsin-Madison, Uni of Michigan and Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05603) “Everything Everywhere All at Once: LLMs can In-Context Learn Multiple Tasks in Superposition”. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. This study explores a surprising phenomenon related to ICL: LLMs can perform multiple, computationally distinct ICL tasks simultaneously, during a single inference call, a capability we term "task superposition". The study provides empirical evidence of this phenomenon across various LLM families and scales and show that this phenomenon emerges even if the authors train the model to in-context learn one task at a time. The work offers theoretical explanations that this capability is well within the expressive power of transformers. The study also explores how LLMs internally compose task vectors during superposition. Furthermore, the study shows that larger models can solve more ICL tasks in parallel, and better calibrate their output distribution. The findings offer insights into the latent capabilities of LLMs, further substantiate the perspective of "LLMs as superposition of simulators", and raise questions about the mechanisms enabling simultaneous task execution. <br> <br>

29. ***Model Collapse Due to Synthetic Data:  <br>A study reveals that even a small amount of synthetic data can cause severe performance degradation, or "model collapse," in large neural networks. This phenomenon persists even as dataset size increases, prompting further investigation into how scaling affects model robustness.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 8, Meta, NYU and UCLA published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04840) “Strong Model Collapse”. Within the scaling laws paradigm, which underpins the training of large neural networks like ChatGPT and Llama, the authors consider a supervised regression setting and establish the existance of a strong form of the model collapse phenomenon, a critical performance degradation due to synthetic data in the training corpus. The results show that even the smallest fraction of synthetic data (e.g., as little as 1\% of the total training dataset) can still lead to model collapse: larger and larger training sets do not enhance performance. The study further investigates whether increasing model size, an approach aligned with current trends in training large language models, exacerbates or mitigates model collapse. In a simplified regime where neural networks are approximated via random projections of tunable size, the study both theoretically and empirically shows that larger models can amplify model collapse. Interestingly, the theory also indicates that, beyond the interpolation threshold (which can be extremely high for very large datasets), larger models may mitigate the collapse, although they do not entirely prevent it. The theoretical findings are empirically verified through experiments on language models and feed-forward neural networks for images. <br> <br>

31. ***Intelligence at the Edge of Chaos:  <br>Researchers explore how complexity in rule-based systems influences the intelligence exhibited by AI models. They find that systems with intermediate complexity levels lead to more intelligent behavior, suggesting that exposure to complexity may be key to developing artificial intelligence.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 8, Yale Uni, Northwestern Uni and Idaho State Uni published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02536) “Intelligence at the Edge of Chaos”. The study explores the emergence of intelligent behavior in artificial systems by investigating how the complexity of rule-based systems influences the capabilities of models trained to predict these rules. The study focuses on elementary cellular automata (ECA), simple yet powerful one-dimensional systems that generate behaviors ranging from trivial to highly complex. By training distinct Large Language Models (LLMs) on different ECAs, the work evaluated the relationship between the complexity of the rules' behavior and the intelligence exhibited by the LLMs, as reflected in their performance on downstream tasks. The findings reveal that rules with higher complexity lead to models exhibiting greater intelligence, as demonstrated by their performance on reasoning and chess move prediction tasks. Both uniform and periodic systems, and often also highly chaotic systems, resulted in poorer downstream performance, highlighting a sweet spot of complexity conducive to intelligence. The work conjectures that intelligence arises from the ability to predict complexity and that creating intelligence may require only exposure to complexity. <br> <br>

33. ***Differential Transformer (Microsoft & Tsinghua University):  <br>This work introduces Diff Transformer, which enhances attention to relevant context while reducing noise by using a differential attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in various language modeling tasks, including long-context modeling and hallucination mitigation. The architecture shows improved performance compared to standard transformers and enhances in-context learning robustness.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 8, Microsoft and Tsinghua Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05258) “Differential Transformer”. Transformer tends to overallocate attention to irrelevant context. This work introduces Diff Transformer, which amplifies attention to the relevant context while canceling noise. Specifically, the differential attention mechanism calculates attention scores as the difference between two separate softmax attention maps. The subtraction cancels noise, promoting the emergence of sparse attention patterns. Experimental results on language modeling show that Diff Transformer outperforms Transformer in various settings of scaling up model size and training tokens. More intriguingly, it offers notable advantages in practical applications, such as long-context modeling, key information retrieval, hallucination mitigation, in-context learning, and reduction of activation outliers. By being less distracted by irrelevant context, Diff Transformer can mitigate hallucination in question answering and text summarization. For in-context learning, Diff Transformer not only enhances accuracy but is also more robust to order permutation, which was considered as a chronic robustness issue. The results position Diff Transformer as a highly effective and promising architecture to advance large language models.

It surpasses models like Mistral 7B and Llama3.1, offering faster inference and lower memory requirements. The model outperforms Transformer-based and hybrid designs, making it a top-performing Mamba model.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 7, TII Aub Dhabi published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05355) “Falcon Mamba: The First Competitive Attention-free 7B Language Model”. This report presents Falcon Mamba 7B, a new base large language model based on the novel Mamba architecture. Falcon Mamba 7B is trained on 5.8 trillion tokens with carefully selected data mixtures. As a pure Mamba-based model, Falcon Mamba 7B surpasses leading open-weight models based on Transformers, such as Mistral 7B, Llama3.1 8B, and Falcon2 11B. It is on par with Gemma 7B and outperforms models with different architecture designs, such as RecurrentGemma 9B and RWKV-v6 Finch 7B/14B. Currently, Falcon Mamba 7B is the best-performing Mamba model in the literature at this scale, surpassing both existing Mamba and hybrid Mamba-Transformer models, according to the Open LLM Leaderboard. Due to its architecture, Falcon Mamba 7B is significantly faster at inference and requires substantially less memory for long sequence generation. Despite recent studies suggesting that hybrid Mamba-Transformer models outperform pure architecture designs, the work demonstrates that even the pure Mamba design can achieve similar, or even superior results compared to the Transformer and hybrid designs.

It finds that models encode much more information about truthfulness than previously recognized, with certain tokens holding more truthfulness information. However, this information is multifaceted, and error detectors often fail to generalize across datasets. The research also reveals a discrepancy between the model’s internal truthfulness representation and its external behavior.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 7, Technion, Google and Apple published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02707) “LLMs Know More Than They Show: On the Intrinsic Representation of LLM Hallucinations”. Large language models (LLMs) often produce errors, including factual inaccuracies, biases, and reasoning failures, collectively referred to as "hallucinations". Recent studies have demonstrated that LLMs' internal states encode information regarding the truthfulness of their outputs, and that this information can be utilized to detect errors. This study shows that the internal representations of LLMs encode much more information about truthfulness than previously recognized. The work first discovers that the truthfulness information is concentrated in specific tokens, and leveraging this property significantly enhances error detection performance. Yet, the work shows that such error detectors fail to generalize across datasets, implying that -- contrary to prior claims -- truthfulness encoding is not universal but rather multifaceted. Next, the study shows that internal representations can also be used for predicting the types of errors the model is likely to make, facilitating the development of tailored mitigation strategies. Lastly, the study reveals a discrepancy between LLMs' internal encoding and external behavior: they may encode the correct answer, yet consistently generate an incorrect one. Taken together, these insights deepen researchers understanding of LLM errors from the model's internal perspective, which can guide future research on enhancing error analysis and mitigation. <br> <br>

39. ***SFTMix for Instruction-Tuning (MIT & Zoom):  <br>SFTMix is a method for improving instruction-tuning in language models without relying on curated datasets. It uses confidence-level-based training dynamics to improve learning and reduce overfitting. The approach leads to significant performance gains across various tasks and model families.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 7, MIT and Zoom published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05248) “SFTMix: Elevating Language Model Instruction Tuning with Mixup Recipe”. To induce desired behaviors in large language models (LLMs) for interaction-driven tasks, the instruction-tuning stage typically trains LLMs on instruction-response pairs using the next-token prediction (NTP) loss. Previous work aiming to improve instruction-tuning performance often emphasizes the need for higher-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, which typically involves expensive data filtering with proprietary LLMs or labor-intensive data generation by human annotators. However, these approaches do not fully leverage the datasets' intrinsic properties, resulting in high computational and labor costs, thereby limiting scalability and performance gains. This paper proposes SFTMix, a novel recipe that elevates instruction-tuning performance beyond the conventional NTP paradigm, without the need for well-curated datasets. Observing that LLMs exhibit uneven confidence across the semantic representation space, the study argues that examples with different confidence levels should play distinct roles during the instruction-tuning process. Based on this insight, SFTMix leverages training dynamics to identify examples with varying confidence levels, then applies a Mixup-based regularization to mitigate overfitting on confident examples while propagating supervision signals to improve learning on relatively unconfident ones. This approach enables SFTMix to significantly outperform NTP across a wide range of instruction-following and healthcare domain-specific SFT tasks, demonstrating its adaptability to diverse LLM families and scalability to datasets of any size. Comprehensive ablation studies further verify the robustness of SFTMix's design choices, underscoring its versatility in consistently enhancing performance across different LLMs and datasets in broader natural language processing applications. <br> <br>

41. ***Instruction Diversity for Generalization (University of Illinois, University of Chicago & Meta):  <br>This study investigates the importance of instruction diversity in large language models. It shows that generalization only occurs when training data is sufficiently diverse across semantic domains. Cross-domain data diversification leads to better adaptability, offering insights for optimizing datasets for specialist and generalist models.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 7, Uni of Illinois, Uni of Chicago and Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04717) “Only-IF:Revealing the Decisive Effect of Instruction Diversity on Generalization”. Understanding and accurately following instructions is critical for large language models (LLMs) to be effective across diverse tasks. This work rigorously examines the key factors that enable models to generalize to unseen instructions, providing insights to guide the collection of data for instruction-tuning. Through controlled experiments, inspired by the Turing-complete Markov algorithm, the study demonstrates that such generalization only emerges when training data is diversified enough across semantic domains. The findings also reveal that merely diversifying within limited domains fails to ensure robust generalization. In contrast, crossdomain data diversification, even under constrained data budgets, significantly enhances a model’s adaptability. The study further extends the analysis to real-world scenarios, including fine-tuning of specialist and generalist models. In both cases, the study demonstrates that 1) better performance can be achieved by increasing the diversity of an established dataset while keeping the data size constant, and 2) when scaling up the data, diversifying the semantics of instructions is more effective than simply increasing the quantity of similar data. The research provides important insights for dataset collation, particularly when optimizing model performance by expanding training data for both specialist and generalist scenarios. The work shows that careful consideration of data diversification is key: training specialist models with data extending beyond their core domain leads to significant performance improvements, while generalist models benefit from diverse data mixtures that enhance their overall instruction-following capabilities across a wide range of applications. The results highlight the critical role of strategic diversification and offer clear guidelines for improving data quality. <br> <br>

43. ***TidalDecode: Position Persistent Sparse Attention (CMU):  <br>TidalDecode is a method for fast and accurate decoding in long-context LLMs by improving sparse attention mechanisms. It reduces token selection overhead while maintaining the quality of generated results, cutting decoding latency by up to 2.1x compared to full attention methods.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 7, CMU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05076) “TidalDecode: Fast and Accurate LLM Decoding with Position Persistent Sparse Attention”. Large language models (LLMs) have driven significant advancements across diverse NLP tasks, with long-context models gaining prominence for handling extended inputs. However, the expanding key-value (KV) cache size required by Transformer architectures intensifies the memory constraints, particularly during the decoding phase, creating a significant bottleneck. Existing sparse attention mechanisms designed to address this bottleneck have two limitations: (1) they often fail to reliably identify the most relevant tokens for attention, and (2) they overlook the spatial coherence of token selection across consecutive Transformer layers, which can lead to performance degradation and substantial overhead in token selection. This paper introduces TidalDecode, a simple yet effective algorithm and system for fast and accurate LLM decoding through position persistent sparse attention. TidalDecode leverages the spatial coherence of tokens selected by existing sparse attention methods and introduces a few token selection layers that perform full attention to identify the tokens with the highest attention scores, while all other layers perform sparse attention with the pre-selected tokens. This design enables TidalDecode to substantially reduce the overhead of token selection for sparse attention without sacrificing the quality of the generated results. Evaluation on a diverse set of LLMs and tasks shows that TidalDecode closely matches the generative performance of full attention methods while reducing the LLM decoding latency by up to 2.1x. <br> <br>

45. ***Input-Adaptive Computation in LMs (MIT):  <br>This paper presents an approach to allocate computation adaptively based on input complexity. It dynamically adjusts the resources needed for generating responses, reducing computation costs by up to 50% without sacrificing quality, or improving quality by up to 10%.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 7, MIT published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04707) “Learning How Hard to Think: Input-Adaptive Allocation of LM Computation”. Computationally intensive decoding procedures—including search, reranking, and self-critique—can improve the quality of language model (LM) outputs in problems spanning code generation, numerical reasoning, and dialog. Existing work typically applies the same decoding procedure for every input to an LM. But not all inputs require the same amount of computation to process. Can we allocate decoding computation adaptively, using more resources to answer questions whose answers will be harder to compute? The paper presents an approach that predicts the distribution of rewards given an input and computation budget, then allocates additional computation to inputs for which it is predicted to be most useful. The work applies this approach in two decoding procedures: first, an adaptive best-of-k procedure that dynamically selects the number of samples to generate as input to a reranker; second, a routing procedure that dynamically responds to a query using a decoding procedure that is expensive but accurate, or one that is cheaper but less capable. Across a suite of programming, mathematics, and dialog tasks, the study shows that accurate computation-allocation procedures can be learned, and reduce computation by up to 50% at no cost to response quality, or improve quality by up to 10% at a fixed computational budget. <br> <br>

47. ***VLM2Vec for Multimodal Embedding (University of Waterloo & Salesforce Research):  <br>VLM2Vec is a framework that transforms vision-language models into embedding models. It performs well on a new multimodal embedding benchmark (MMEB), outperforming existing models in various tasks such as classification and multimodal retrieval.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 7, Uni of Waterloo and Salesforce Research published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05160) “VLM2Vec: Training Vision-Language Models for Massive Multimodal Embedding Tasks”.  Embedding models have been crucial in enabling various downstream tasks such as semantic similarity, information retrieval, and clustering. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in developing universal text embedding models that can generalize across tasks (e.g., MTEB). However, progress in learning universal multimodal embedding models has been relatively slow despite their importance. This work aims to explore the potential for building universal embeddings capable of handling a wide range of downstream tasks. The contributions are twofold: (1) MMEB (Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark), which covers 4 meta-tasks (i.e. classification, visual question answering, multimodal retrieval, and visual grounding) and 36 datasets, including 20 training and 16 evaluation datasets, and (2) VLM2Vec (Vision-Language Model -> Vector), a contrastive training framework that converts any state-of-the-art vision-language model into an embedding model via training on MMEB. Unlike previous models such as CLIP and BLIP, VLM2Vec can process any combination of images and text to generate a fixed-dimensional vector based on task instructions. The study builds a series of VLM2Vec models on Phi-3.5-V and evaluate them on MMEB's evaluation split. The results show that VLM2Vec achieves an absolute average improvement of 10% to 20% over existing multimodal embedding models on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets in MMEB. <br> <br>

49. ***Mitigating Loss Spikes in LLMs (NTT Corp.):  <br>This work introduces a reparameterization technique called WeSaR to mitigate loss spikes during LLM training. By uniformly scaling the parameters’ norm, WeSaR stabilizes and accelerates training, outperforming existing methods for large Transformer models.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 7, NTT Corp. published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05052) on EMNLP2024 “Initialization of Large Language Models via Reparameterization to Mitigate Loss Spikes”. Loss spikes, a phenomenon in which the loss value diverges suddenly, is a fundamental issue in the pre-training of large language models. This paper supposes that the non-uniformity of the norm of the parameters is one of the causes of loss spikes. Here, in training of neural networks, the scale of the gradients is required to be kept constant throughout the layers to avoid the vanishing and exploding gradients problem. However, to meet these requirements in the Transformer model, the norm of the model parameters must be non-uniform, and thus, parameters whose norm is smaller are more sensitive to the parameter update. To address this issue, the study proposes a novel technique, weight scaling as reparameterization (WeSaR). WeSaR introduces a gate parameter per parameter matrix and adjusts it to the value satisfying the requirements. Because of the gate parameter, WeSaR sets the norm of the original parameters uniformly, which results in stable training. Experimental results with the Transformer decoders consisting of 130 million, 1.3 billion, and 13 billion parameters showed that WeSaR stabilizes and accelerates training and that it outperformed compared methods including popular initialization methods. <br> <br>

51. ***Inference Scaling for Long-Context RAG (Google):  <br>This study explores strategies for scaling inference computation in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It demonstrates that scaling test-time computation yields linear performance improvements. The work also provides a model for predicting optimal inference configurations, achieving up to 58.9% gains in performance on benchmark datasets.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 6, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04343) “Inference Scaling for Long-Context Retrieval Augmented Generation”. The scaling of inference computation has unlocked the potential of long-context large language models (LLMs) across diverse settings. For knowledge-intensive tasks, the increased compute is often allocated to incorporate more external knowledge. However, without effectively utilizing such knowledge, solely expanding context does not always enhance performance. This work investigates inference scaling for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), exploring strategies beyond simply increasing the quantity of knowledge. The study focuses on two inference scaling strategies: in-context learning and iterative prompting. These strategies provide additional flexibility to scale test-time computation (e.g., by increasing retrieved documents or generation steps), thereby enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively acquire and utilize contextual information. The work addresses two key questions: (1) How does RAG performance benefit from the scaling of inference computation when optimally configured? (2) Can we predict the optimal test-time compute allocation for a given budget by modeling the relationship between RAG performance and inference parameters? The observations reveal that increasing inference computation leads to nearly linear gains in RAG performance when optimally allocated, a relationship described as the inference scaling laws for RAG. Building on this, the work further develops the computation allocation model to estimate RAG performance across different inference configurations. The model predicts optimal inference parameters under various computation constraints, which align closely with the experimental results. By applying these optimal configurations, the work demonstrates that scaling inference compute on long-context LLMs achieves up to 58.9% gains on benchmark datasets compared to standard RAG. <br> <br>

53. ***Algorithmic Capabilities of Random Transformers (MIT):  <br>This paper shows that random transformers, without training, can perform algorithmic tasks such as modular arithmetic and decimal addition. The findings suggest that some algorithmic capabilities are inherent in transformers and can be accessed through structured inputs.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 6, MIT published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04368) “Algorithmic Capabilities of Random Transformers”. Trained transformer models have been found to implement interpretable procedures for tasks like arithmetic and associative recall, but little is understood about how the circuits that implement these procedures originate during training. To what extent do they depend on the supervisory signal provided to models, and to what extent are they attributable to behavior already present in models at the beginning of training? To investigate these questions, the study investigates what functions can be learned by randomly initialized transformers in which only the embedding layers are optimized, so that the only input--output mappings learnable from data are those already implemented (up to a choice of encoding scheme) by the randomly initialized model. The study finds that these random transformers can perform a wide range of meaningful algorithmic tasks, including modular arithmetic, in-weights and in-context associative recall, decimal addition, parenthesis balancing, and even some aspects of natural language text generation. The results indicate that some algorithmic capabilities are present in transformers (and accessible via appropriately structured inputs) even before these models are trained.

55. ***Steering LLMs Between Code and Text Reasoning (MIT, Harvard, Microsoft, & Google):  <br>This study examines the challenge of steering LLMs to alternate between textual reasoning and code execution. It presents methods to improve steering, demonstrating notable improvements but highlighting areas for further research in efficiently combining these reasoning modes.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 4, MIT, Harvard, Microsoft and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03524) “Steering Large Language Models between Code Execution and Textual Reasoning”. While a lot of recent research focuses on enhancing the textual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by optimizing the multi-agent framework or reasoning chains, several benchmark tasks can be solved with 100% success through direct coding, which is more scalable and avoids the computational overhead associated with textual iterating and searching. Textual reasoning has inherent limitations in solving tasks with challenges in math, logics, optimization, and searching, which is unlikely to be solved by simply scaling up the model and data size. The recently released OpenAI GPT Code Interpreter and multi-agent frameworks such as AutoGen have demonstrated remarkable proficiency of integrating code generation and execution to solve complex tasks using LLMs. However, based on the authors’ experiments on 7 existing popular methods for steering code/text generation in both single- and multi-turn settings with 14 tasks and 6 types of LLMs (including the new O1-preview), currently there is no optimal method to correctly steer LLMs to write code when needed. The study discovers some interesting patterns on when models use code vs. textual reasoning with the evolution to task complexity and model sizes, which even result in an astonishingly inverse scaling law. The work also discovers that results from LLM written code are not always better than using textual reasoning, even if the task could be solved through code. To mitigate the above issues, the study proposes three methods to better steer LLM code/text generation and achieve a notable improvement. The costs of token lengths and runtime are thoroughly discussed for all the methods. The authors believe the problem of steering LLM code/text generation is critical for future research and has much space for further improvement.

57. ***Autoregressive LLMs as Universal Computers (Google & University of Alberta):  <br>This work proves that autoregressive decoding of a transformer-based LLM can realize universal computation, capable of simulating a Turing machine with no external modifications. The study provides insights into how LLMs process long inputs and demonstrates the computational universality of autoregressive models.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 4, Google and Uni of Alberta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03170) “Autoregressive Large Language Models are Computationally Universal”. The study shows that autoregressive decoding of a transformer-based language model can realize universal computation, without external intervention or modification of the model's weights. Establishing this result requires understanding how a language model can process arbitrarily long inputs using a bounded context. For this purpose, the work considers a generalization of autoregressive decoding where, given a long input, emitted tokens are appended to the end of the sequence as the context window advances. The study first shows that the resulting system corresponds to a classical model of computation, a Lag system, that has long been known to be computationally universal. By leveraging a new proof, the work shows that a universal Turing machine can be simulated by a Lag system with 2027 production rules. The study then investigates whether an existing large language model can simulate the behaviour of such a universal Lag system. The authors give an affirmative answer by showing that a single system-prompt can be developed for gemini-1.5-pro-001 that drives the model, under deterministic (greedy) decoding, to correctly apply each of the 2027 production rules. The paper concludes that, by the Church-Turing thesis, prompted gemini-1.5-pro-001 with extended autoregressive (greedy) decoding is a general purpose computer. <br> <br>

59. ***In-Context Learning with Spurious Correlations (Google & YerevaNN):  <br>This paper highlights the susceptibility of in-context learners to spurious correlations, especially in classification tasks. A novel technique is proposed to train learners that generalize well to unseen tasks, outperforming traditional methods like ERM.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 4, Google, YerevaNN and Yerevan State Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03140) “In-context Learning in Presence of Spurious Correlations”. Large language models exhibit a remarkable capacity for in-context learning, where they learn to solve tasks given a few examples. Recent work has shown that transformers can be trained to perform simple regression tasks in-context. This work explores the possibility of training an in-context learner for classification tasks involving spurious features. The researchers find that the conventional approach of training in-context learners is susceptible to spurious features. Moreover, when the meta-training dataset includes instances of only one task, the conventional approach leads to task memorization and fails to produce a model that leverages context for predictions. Based on these observations, the work proposes a novel technique to train such a learner for a given classification task. Remarkably, this in-context learner matches and sometimes outperforms strong methods like ERM and GroupDRO. However, unlike these algorithms, it does not generalize well to other tasks. The study shows that it is possible to obtain an in-context learner that generalizes to unseen tasks by training on a diverse dataset of synthetic in-context learning instances. <br> <br>

61. ***Model Merging at Scale (University of North Carolina, Google, & Virginia Tech):  <br>This study investigates the benefits of merging expert models into a single model. It shows that merging leads to better generalization, especially with larger models, and merging expert models is easier when they are derived from strong base models. Findings reveal that merging can outperform multi-task trained models.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 4, Uni of North Carolina, Google and Virgina Tech published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03617) “What Matters for Model Merging at Scale”. Model merging aims to combine multiple expert models into a more capable single model, offering benefits such as reduced storage and serving costs, improved generalization, and support for decentralized model development. Despite its promise, previous studies have primarily focused on merging a few small models. This leaves many unanswered questions about the effect of scaling model size and how it interplays with other key factors -- like the base model quality and number of expert models -- , to affect the merged model's performance. This work systematically evaluates the utility of model merging at scale, examining the impact of these different factors. The authors experiment with merging fully fine-tuned models using 4 popular merging methods -- Averaging, Task~Arithmetic, Dare, and TIES -- across model sizes ranging from 1B-64B parameters and merging up to 8 different expert models. The study evaluates the merged models on both held-in tasks, i.e., the expert's training tasks, and zero-shot generalization to unseen held-out tasks. Experiments provide several new insights about model merging at scale and the interplay between different factors. First, the study finds that merging is more effective when experts are created from strong base models, i.e., models with good zero-shot performance. Second, larger models facilitate easier merging. Third merging consistently improves generalization capabilities. Notably, when merging 8 large expert models, the merged models often generalize better compared to the multitask trained models. Fourth, the authors can better merge more expert models when working with larger models. Fifth, different merging methods behave very similarly at larger scales. Overall, the findings shed light on some interesting properties of model merging while also highlighting some limitations. <br> <br>

63. ***Tutor CoPilot’s Potential to Revolutionize Education <br>
Stanford University introduced "Tutor CoPilot," a Human-AI system that provides expert-like guidance to novice tutors, particularly benefiting under-served communities. The system increased student mastery by 4 percentage points, with lower-rated tutors seeing the greatest improvement at 9 points. At a cost of $20 per tutor annually, Tutor CoPilot enhanced pedagogical strategies, encouraging tutors to ask guiding questions rather than giving away answers. However, there were concerns about the system providing suggestions not appropriate for certain grade levels.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 3, Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03017) “Tutor CoPilot: A Human-AI Approach for Scaling Real-Time Expertise”. Generative AI, particularly Language Models (LMs), has the potential to transform real-world domains with societal impact, particularly where access to experts is limited. For example, in education, training novice educators with expert guidance is important for effectiveness but expensive, creating significant barriers to improving education quality at scale. This challenge disproportionately harms students from under-served communities, who stand to gain the most from high-quality education. The study introduces Tutor CoPilot, a novel Human-AI approach that leverages a model of expert thinking to provide expert-like guidance to tutors as they tutor. This study is the first randomized controlled trial of a Human-AI system in live tutoring, involving 900 tutors and 1,800 K-12 students from historically under-served communities. Following a preregistered analysis plan, The study finds that students working with tutors that have access to Tutor CoPilot are 4 percentage points (p.p.) more likely to master topics (p<0.01). Notably, students of lower-rated tutors experienced the greatest benefit, improving mastery by 9 p.p. The study finds that Tutor CoPilot costs only $20 per-tutor annually. The authors analyze 550,000+ messages using classifiers to identify pedagogical strategies, and find that tutors with access to Tutor CoPilot are more likely to use high-quality strategies to foster student understanding (e.g., asking guiding questions) and less likely to give away the answer to the student. Tutor interviews highlight how Tutor CoPilot's guidance helps tutors to respond to student needs, though they flag issues in Tutor CoPilot, such as generating suggestions that are not grade-level appropriate. Altogether, the study of Tutor CoPilot demonstrates how Human-AI systems can scale expertise in real-world domains, bridge gaps in skills and create a future where high-quality education is accessible to all students. <br> <br>

The University of Wisconsin-Madison, Nvidia, and Cornell University developed AutoDAN-Turbo, a black-box method that autonomously discovers jailbreak strategies for large language models (LLMs). AutoDAN-Turbo achieved a 74.3% higher attack success rate than other methods and can integrate human-designed strategies to further increase success to 93.4% on GPT-4-1106-turbo. This method significantly advances red-teaming strategies by automating the discovery process without predefined constraints.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 3, Uni of Wisconsic-Madison, Nvidia, Cornell Uni, et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05295) “AutoDAN-Turbo: A Lifelong Agent for Strategy Self-Exploration to Jailbreak LLMs”. The study proposes AutoDAN-Turbo, a black-box jailbreak method that can automatically discover as many jailbreak strategies as possible from scratch, without any human intervention or predefined scopes (e.g., specified candidate strategies), and use them for red-teaming. As a result, AutoDAN-Turbo can significantly outperform baseline methods, achieving a 74.3% higher average attack success rate on public benchmarks. Notably, AutoDAN-Turbo achieves an 88.5 attack success rate on GPT-4-1106-turbo. In addition, AutoDAN-Turbo is a unified framework that can incorporate existing human-designed jailbreak strategies in a plug-and-play manner. By integrating human-designed strategies, AutoDAN-Turbo can even achieve a higher attack success rate of 93.4 on GPT-4-1106-turbo.

67. ***Evaluating Planning Capabilities in Large Reasoning Models <br>
Arizona State University evaluated OpenAI’s "Strawberry" (o1) Large Reasoning Model (LRM) for its planning and scheduling capabilities. While o1 improves upon autoregressive LLMs, it comes with high inference costs and lacks generation guarantees. The study also demonstrated that combining o1 with external verifiers (LRM-Modulo) improves performance and ensures output correctness, showing a potential for more robust planning systems in AI.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 3, Arizona State Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02162) “Planning in Strawberry Fields: Evaluating and Improving the Planning and Scheduling Capabilities of LRM o1”. The ability to plan a course of action that achieves a desired state of affairs has long been considered a core competence of intelligent agents and has been an integral part of AI research since its inception. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), there has been considerable interest in the question of whether or not they possess such planning abilities, but -- despite the slew of new private and open source LLMs since GPT3 -- progress has remained slow. OpenAI claims that their recent o1 (Strawberry) model has been specifically constructed and trained to escape the normal limitations of autoregressive LLMs -- making it a new kind of model: a Large Reasoning Model (LRM). This work evaluates the planning capabilities of two LRMs (o1-preview and o1-mini) on both planning and scheduling benchmarks. The work finds that while o1 does seem to offer significant improvements over autoregressive LLMs, this comes at a steep inference cost, while still failing to provide any guarantees over what it generates. The study also shows that combining o1 models with external verifiers -- in a so-called LRM-Modulo system -- guarantees the correctness of the combined system's output while further improving performance. <br> <br>

69. ***Energy-Efficient Multiplication with L-Mul Algorithm <br>
BitEnergy AI introduced the L-Mul algorithm, which replaces floating-point multiplications with integer additions, offering up to 95% energy savings for tensor processing. Despite lower computational costs, L-Mul achieves higher precision than 8-bit floating point multiplication and performs well across various tasks such as natural language processing, mathematics, and reasoning. The study highlights the potential for L-Mul to enhance energy efficiency in AI models without sacrificing accuracy.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 2, BitEnergy AI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00907) “Addition is All You Need for Energy-efficient Language Models”.  Large neural networks spend most computation on floating point tensor multiplications. This work finds that a floating point multiplier can be approximated by one integer adder with high precision. The work proposes the linear-complexity multiplication L-Mul algorithm that approximates floating point number multiplication with integer addition operations. The new algorithm costs significantly less computation resource than 8-bit floating point multiplication but achieves higher precision. Compared to 8-bit floating point multiplications, the proposed method achieves higher precision but consumes significantly less bit-level computation. Since multiplying floating point numbers requires substantially higher energy compared to integer addition operations, applying the L-Mul operation in tensor processing hardware can potentially reduce 95% energy cost by element-wise floating point tensor multiplications and 80% energy cost of dot products. The authors calculated the theoretical error expectation of L-Mul, and evaluated the algorithm on a wide range of textual, visual, and symbolic tasks, including natural language understanding, structural reasoning, mathematics, and commonsense question answering. The numerical analysis experiments agree with the theoretical error estimation, which indicates that L-Mul with 4-bit mantissa achieves comparable precision as float8_e4m3 multiplications, and L-Mul with 3-bit mantissa outperforms float8_e5m2. Evaluation results on popular benchmarks show that directly applying L-Mul to the attention mechanism is almost lossless. The study further shows that replacing all floating point multiplications with 3-bit mantissa L-Mul in a transformer model achieves equivalent precision as using float8_e4m3 as accumulation precision in both fine-tuning and inference. <br> <br>

71. ***CGPO: A Breakthrough in Multi-Task Learning for RLHF <br>
Meta introduced Constrained Generative Policy Optimization (CGPO) as a novel approach to address the challenges of reward hacking and multi-objective optimization in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). CGPO outperformed traditional RLHF methods in tasks like general chat and STEM questions, showing improvements of up to 12.5%. Its ability to optimize across multiple objectives without extensive tuning makes it a promising solution for aligning LLMs in diverse applications.*** <br> <br>
    Oct 1, Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20370) “The Perfect Blend: Redefining RLHF with Mixture of Judges”. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become the leading approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLM). However, RLHF has limitations in multi-task learning (MTL) due to challenges of reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization (i.e., trade-off of multiple and/or sometimes conflicting objectives). Applying RLHF for MTL currently requires careful tuning of the weights for reward model and data combinations. This is often done via human intuition and does not generalize. This study introduces a novel post-training paradigm which is called Constrained Generative Policy Optimization (CGPO). The core of CGPO is Mixture of Judges (MoJ) with cost-efficient constrained policy optimization with stratification, which can identify the perfect blend in RLHF in a principled manner. It shows strong empirical results with theoretical guarantees, does not require extensive hyper-parameter tuning, and is plug-and-play in common post-training pipelines. Together, this can detect and mitigate reward hacking behaviors while reaching a pareto-optimal point across an extremely large number of objectives. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CGPO significantly outperforms standard RLHF algorithms like PPO and DPO across various tasks including general chat, STEM questions, instruction following, and coding. Specifically, CGPO shows improvements of 7.4% in AlpacaEval-2 (general chat), 12.5% in Arena-Hard (STEM & reasoning), and consistent gains in other domains like math and coding. Notably, PPO, while commonly used, is prone to severe reward hacking in popular coding benchmarks, which CGPO successfully addresses. This breakthrough in RLHF not only tackles reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization challenges but also advances the state-of-the-art in aligning general-purpose LLMs for diverse applications. <br> <br>

MIT introduced "SciAgents," a system that uses knowledge graphs, LLMs, and multi-agent systems to automate scientific discovery. Applied to materials science, SciAgents autonomously generated and refined hypotheses, uncovering interdisciplinary connections that surpass traditional research methods. This system accelerates scientific innovation by integrating AI’s capacity for pattern recognition with large-scale data exploration, unlocking new material design principles inspired by nature.*** <br> <br>
    Sep 9, MIT published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05556) “SciAgents: Automating scientific discovery through multi-agent intelligent graph reasoning”. A key challenge in artificial intelligence is the creation of systems capable of autonomously advancing scientific understanding by exploring novel domains, identifying complex patterns, and uncovering previously unseen connections in vast scientific data. This paper presents SciAgents, an approach that leverages three core concepts: (1) the use of large-scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts, (2) a suite of large language models (LLMs) and data retrieval tools, and (3) multi-agent systems with in-situ learning capabilities. Applied to biologically inspired materials, SciAgents reveals hidden interdisciplinary relationships that were previously considered unrelated, achieving a scale, precision, and exploratory power that surpasses traditional human-driven research methods. The framework autonomously generates and refines research hypotheses, elucidating underlying mechanisms, design principles, and unexpected material properties. By integrating these capabilities in a modular fashion, the intelligent system yields material discoveries, critique and improve existing hypotheses, retrieve up-to-date data about existing research, and highlights their strengths and limitations. The case studies demonstrate scalable capabilities to combine generative AI, ontological representations, and multi-agent modeling, harnessing a ‘swarm of intelligence’ similar to biological systems. This provides new avenues for materials discovery and accelerates the development of advanced materials by unlocking Nature's design principles.

The models set new standards in video and audio synthesis tasks. The paper highlights technical advancements and simplifications that enable scaling for large-scale media generation, hoping to accelerate progress in this research field.*** <br>
   Oct 4, Meta [released MovieGen](https://ai.meta.com/research/movie-gen/), and the [paper](https://ai.meta.com/static-resource/movie-gen-research-paper) “Movie Gen: A Cast of Media Foundation Models”. The paper presents Movie Gen, a cast of foundation models that generates high-quality, 1080p HD videos with different aspect ratios and synchronized audio. Meta also shows additional capabilities such as precise instruction-based video editing and generation of personalized videos based on a user’s image.

3. ***Quantifying generalization in large language models (LLMs):  <br>A joint paper from Harvard, MIT, and others introduced Scylla, a framework to measure LLMs' generalization by separating it from memorization. The study introduces the concept of critical complexity, where models begin to rely on memorization. The results suggest larger models handle more complex tasks better, and Scylla helps evaluate 28 LLMs, offering insight into their generalization.*** <br>
   Oct 3, Harvard Uni, MIT, UIUC, Meta and Uni of Chicago published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01769) “Quantifying Generalization Complexity for Large Language Models”. While large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in understanding complex queries and performing sophisticated tasks, their generalization abilities are often deeply entangled with memorization, necessitating more precise evaluation. To address this challenge, the study introduces Scylla, a dynamic evaluation framework that quantitatively measures the generalization abilities of LLMs. Scylla disentangles generalization from memorization via assessing model performance on both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data through 20 tasks across 5 levels of complexity. Through extensive experiments, the study uncovers a non-monotonic relationship between task complexity and the performance gap between ID and OOD data, which the authors term the generalization valley. Specifically, this phenomenon reveals a critical threshold - referred to as critical complexity - where reliance on non-generalizable behavior peaks, indicating the upper bound of LLMs' generalization capabilities. As model size increases, the critical complexity shifts toward higher levels of task complexity, suggesting that larger models can handle more complex reasoning tasks before over-relying on memorization. Leveraging Scylla and the concept of critical complexity, the authors benchmark 28 LLMs including both open-sourced models such as LLaMA and Qwen families, and close-sourced models like Claude and GPT, providing a more robust evaluation and establishing a clearer understanding of LLMs' generalization capabilities.   <br>

5. ***LLMs as Markov Chains and theoretical insights:  <br>A paper by ENS Paris-Saclay and collaborators explored LLMs' performance using Markov chain theory. It found parallels between autoregressive models and Markov chains, uncovering key insights about stationary distributions and the effect of temperature on convergence. The study also offers theoretical guarantees for LLM performance through experiments.*** <br>
   Oct 3, ENS Paris-Saclay, Ark Lab, and Inria Paris published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02724) “Large Language Models as Markov Chains”. Large language models (LLMs) have proven to be remarkably efficient, both across a wide range of natural language processing tasks and well beyond them. However, a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the origins of their impressive performance remains elusive. This study approaches this challenging task by drawing an equivalence between generic autoregressive language models with vocabulary of size T and context window of size K and Markov chains defined on a finite state space of size O(T^K). The study derives several surprising findings related to the existence of a stationary distribution of Markov chains that capture the inference power of LLMs, their speed of convergence to it, and the influence of the temperature on the latter. The study then proves pre-training and in-context generalization bounds and show how the drawn equivalence allows the authors to enrich their interpretation. Finally, the study illustrates the theoretical guarantees with experiments on several recent LLMs to highlight how they capture the behavior observed in practice. <br>

7. ***Apple’s advances in vision-language models with CLOC:  <br>Apple proposed Contrastive Localized Language-Image Pre-training (CLOC), which improves upon CLIP by enhancing regional understanding in multimodal large language models. This method, focused on generating high-quality regional embeddings, outperforms CLIP in image region recognition tasks, and its scaling with billions of annotated images enables more precise language-image alignment.*** <br>
   Oct 3, Apple published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02746) “Contrastive Localized Language-Image Pre-Training”. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has been a celebrated method for training vision encoders to generate image/text representations facilitating various applications. Recently, CLIP has been widely adopted as the vision backbone of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to connect image inputs for language interactions. The success of CLIP as a vision-language foundation model relies on aligning web-crawled noisy text annotations at image levels. Nevertheless, such criteria may become insufficient for downstream tasks in need of fine-grained vision representations, especially when region-level understanding is demanding for MLLMs. This study improves the localization capability of CLIP with several advances, proposes a pre-training method called Contrastive Localized Language-Image Pre-training (CLOC) by complementing CLIP with region-text contrastive loss and modules. The paper formulates a new concept, promptable embeddings, of which the encoder produces image embeddings easy to transform into region representations given spatial hints. To support large-scale pre-training, the authors design a visually-enriched and spatially-localized captioning framework to effectively generate region-text pseudo-labels at scale. By scaling up to billions of annotated images, CLOC enables high-quality regional embeddings for image region recognition and retrieval tasks, and can be a drop-in replacement of CLIP to enhance MLLMs, especially on referring and grounding tasks. <br>

9. ***Mitigating hallucinations in vision-language models:  <br>A study from UC Berkeley tackled hallucinations in vision-language models by projecting their internal image representations to language vocabulary. The researchers developed a knowledge erasure algorithm, reducing hallucinations by 25.7% on the COCO2014 dataset, showing that targeted edits to models' latent representations can improve reliability without affecting overall performance.*** <br>
    Oct 3, UC Berkeley published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02762) “Interpreting and Editing Vision-Language Representations to Mitigate Hallucinations”. The study investigates the internal representations of vision-language models (VLMs) to address hallucinations, a persistent challenge despite advances in model size and training. The work projects VLMs' internal image representations to their language vocabulary and observe more confident output probabilities on real objects than hallucinated objects. The work additionally uses these output probabilities to spatially localize real objects. Building on this approach, the study introduces a knowledge erasure algorithm that removes hallucinations by linearly orthogonalizing image features with respect to hallucinated object features. The authros show that targeted edits to a model's latent representations can reduce hallucinations by up to 25.7% on the COCO2014 dataset while preserving performance. The findings demonstrate how a deeper understanding of VLMs' latent representations can enhance reliability and enable novel capabilities, such as zero-shot segmentation. <br>

11. ***Contextual document embeddings for neural retrieval:  <br>Cornell University published a paper proposing methods for generating contextualized document embeddings by incorporating neighboring documents. These methods, focused on improving performance out-of-domain, achieved state-of-the-art results in several benchmarks, outperforming traditional biencoders. The study suggests these approaches can be broadly applied to contrastive learning datasets.*** <br>
    Oct 3, Cornell Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02762) “Contextual Document Embeddings” . Dense document embeddings are central to neural retrieval. The dominant paradigm is to train and construct embeddings by running encoders directly on individual documents. This paper argues that these embeddings, while effective, are implicitly out-of-context for targeted use cases of retrieval, and that a contextualized document embedding should take into account both the document and neighboring documents in context - analogous to contextualized word embeddings. The study proposes two complementary methods for contextualized document embeddings: first, an alternative contrastive learning objective that explicitly incorporates the document neighbors into the intra-batch contextual loss; second, a new contextual architecture that explicitly encodes neighbor document information into the encoded representation. Results show that both methods achieve better performance than biencoders in several settings, with differences especially pronounced out-of-domain. The proposed models achieve state-of-the-art results on the MTEB benchmark with no hard negative mining, score distillation, dataset-specific instructions, intra-GPU example-sharing, or extremely large batch sizes. The method can be applied to improve performance on any contrastive learning dataset and any biencoder. <br>

13. ***End-to-end voice assistants with DiVA:  <br>A paper from Georgia Tech and others proposed training Speech LLMs without instruction data for voice assistants like Siri. The Distilled Voice Assistant (DiVA) model generalizes well to various tasks like Spoken Question Answering and Translation, outperforming existing models with significantly less training compute, while avoiding loss of text-based capabilities.*** <br>
    Oct 3, Georgia Inst of Tech, Stanford Uni, National Uni of Singapore and Northeastern Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02678) “Distilling an End-to-End Voice Assistant Without Instruction Training Data”. Voice assistants, such as Siri and Google Assistant, typically model audio and text separately, resulting in lost speech information and increased complexity. Recent efforts to address this with end-to-end Speech Large Language Models (LLMs) trained with supervised finetuning (SFT) have led to models “forgetting” capabilities from text-only LLMs. This work proposes an alternative paradigm for training Speech LLMs without instruction data, using the response of a text-only LLM to transcripts as self-supervision. Importantly, this process can be performed without annotated responses. The authors show that the Distilled Voice Assistant (DiVA) generalizes to Spoken Question Answering, Classification, and Translation. Furthermore, the study shows that DiVA better meets user preferences, achieving a 72\% win rate compared with state-of-the-art models like Qwen 2 Audio, despite using >100x less training compute. <br>

15. ***Learning game rules from data with small language models:  <br>Dell published a study showing that small pretrained language models can learn complex rules, like those of chess, from data. The study demonstrated how fine-tuning with increasing examples improved accuracy and reduced hallucinations in these models, indicating that even small models can learn complex processes effectively.*** <br>
    Oct 3, Dell published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02426) “Learning the Latent Rules of a Game from Data: A Chess Story”. The work demonstrates that small pretrained foundational generative language models with millions of parameters can learn the latent rules of a process from data associated with the process. Inspired by Stefan Zweig's novella "Schachnovelle," also known as "The Royal Game" in English, the study shows that 28M and 125M parameter pretrained foundational small language models (SLMs) can be instruction fine-tuned with 1,000-to-1,000,000 examples to learn the rules of chess, propose legal moves, and accurately solve chess problems. The study also explores the impact of successive language model fine-tuning epochs on improved outcomes and demonstrate reductions in model hallucinations by increasing the number of instruction fine-tuning examples. <br>

17. ***Intelligence emergence in rule-based systems:  <br>A study by Yale and others explored how complexity in rule-based systems like elementary cellular automata influences LLM intelligence. The findings suggest that exposure to more complex rules leads to better reasoning performance, indicating that complexity is key to developing intelligent behaviors in artificial systems.*** <br>
    Oct 3, Yale Uni et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02536) “Intelligence at the Edge of Chaos”. The study explores the emergence of intelligent behavior in artificial systems by investigating how the complexity of rule-based systems influences the capabilities of models trained to predict these rules. The study focuses on elementary cellular automata (ECA), simple yet powerful one-dimensional systems that generate behaviors ranging from trivial to highly complex. By training distinct Large Language Models (LLMs) on different ECAs, the work evaluated the relationship between the complexity of the rules' behavior and the intelligence exhibited by the LLMs, as reflected in their performance on downstream tasks. The findings reveal that rules with higher complexity lead to models exhibiting greater intelligence, as demonstrated by their performance on reasoning and chess move prediction tasks. Both uniform and periodic systems, and often also highly chaotic systems, resulted in poorer downstream performance, highlighting a sweet spot of complexity conducive to intelligence. The authors conjecture that intelligence arises from the ability to predict complexity and that creating intelligence may require only exposure to complexity. <br>

19. ***Google’s selective attention mechanism for transformers:  <br>Google introduced a selective attention mechanism that reduces attention to unneeded elements in transformers. This simple change improves performance while reducing memory and compute requirements. Transformers equipped with selective attention require far less memory during inference, making them more efficient without sacrificing accuracy.*** <br>
    Oct 3, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02703) “Selective Attention Improves Transformer”. Unneeded elements in the attention's context degrade performance. The work introduces Selective Attention, a simple parameter-free change to the standard attention mechanism which reduces attention to unneeded elements. Selective attention improves language modeling performance in a variety of model sizes and context lengths. For example, a range of transformers trained with the language modeling objective on C4 with selective attention perform equivalently to standard transformers with ~2X more heads and parameters in their attention modules. Selective attention also allows decreasing the size of the attention's context buffer, leading to meaningful reductions in the memory and compute requirements during inference. For example, transformers with 100M parameters trained on C4 with context sizes of 512, 1,024, and 2,048 need 16X, 25X, and 47X less memory for their attention module, respectively, when equipped with selective attention, as those without selective attention, with the same validation perplexity. <br>

21. ***Evaluating LLMs' reasoning abilities in math problem-solving:  <br>A study by Mila, Google, and Microsoft evaluated LLMs' reasoning on math word problems, revealing a significant gap between solving independent questions and compositional pairs. The study highlights differences in reasoning capabilities among LLMs, with smaller models showing larger reasoning gaps, offering insights into LLMs' systematic reasoning challenges.*** <br>
    Oct 2, Mila, Google and Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01748) “Not All LLM Reasoners Are Created Equal”. The authors study the depth of grade-school math (GSM) problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. To this end, the work evaluates their performance on pairs of existing math word problems together so that the answer to the second problem depends on correctly answering the first problem. The findings reveal a significant reasoning gap in most LLMs, that is performance difference between solving the compositional pairs and solving each question independently. This gap is more pronounced in smaller, more cost-efficient, and math-specialized models. Moreover, instruction-tuning recipes and code generation have varying effects across LLM sizes, while finetuning on GSM can lead to task overfitting. The analysis indicates that large reasoning gaps are not because of test-set leakage, but due to distraction from additional context and poor second-hop reasoning. Overall, LLMs exhibit systematic differences in their reasoning abilities, despite what their performance on standard benchmarks indicates. <br>

23. ***Revisiting recurrent neural networks (RNNs):  <br>A paper from Mila revisited traditional RNNs, demonstrating that by removing certain dependencies, LSTMs and GRUs can be trained in parallel, making them as fast and efficient as newer sequence models. This revival of decade-old models shows they can still compete with modern architectures in handling long sequences.*** <br>
    Oct 2, Mila, Uni of Montreal, Borealis AI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01201) “Were RNNs All We Needed?”. The scalability limitations of Transformers regarding sequence length have renewed interest in recurrent sequence models that are parallelizable during training. As a result, many novel recurrent architectures, such as S4, Mamba, and Aaren, have been proposed that achieve comparable performance. This work revisits traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) from over a decade ago: LSTMs (1997) and GRUs (2014). While these models were slow due to requiring to backpropagate through time (BPTT), the work shows that by removing their hidden state dependencies from their input, forget, and update gates, LSTMs and GRUs no longer need to BPTT and can be efficiently trained in parallel. Building on this, the study introduces minimal versions (minLSTMs and minGRUs) that (1) use significantly fewer parameters than their traditional counterparts and (2) are fully parallelizable during training (175x faster for a sequence of length 512). Lastly, the study shows that these stripped-down versions of decade-old RNNs match the empirical performance of recent sequence models. <br>

25. ***Meta’s RLEF for improving code synthesis:  <br>Meta introduced a reinforcement learning method called RLEF for improving LLMs' performance in code synthesis tasks. The study achieved new state-of-the-art results by teaching models to iteratively improve code using execution feedback. This method significantly reduces the number of samples needed while boosting code generation accuracy.*** <br>
    Oct 2, Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02089) “RLEF: Grounding Code LLMs in Execution Feedback with Reinforcement Learning”. Large language models (LLMs) deployed as agents solve user-specified tasks over multiple steps while keeping the required manual engagement to a minimum. Crucially, such LLMs need to ground their generations in any feedback obtained to reliably achieve desired outcomes. The study proposes an end-to-end reinforcement learning method for teaching models to leverage execution feedback in the realm of code synthesis, where state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to improve code iteratively compared to independent sampling. The study benchmarks on competitive programming tasks, where the authors achieve new start-of-the art results with both small (8B parameters) and large (70B) models while reducing the amount of samples required by an order of magnitude. The analysis of inference-time behavior demonstrates that this method produces LLMs that effectively leverage automatic feedback over multiple steps. <br>


29. ***Advancing Autonomous AI Agents with Reflective Tree Search: <br>Columbia University and Microsoft’s study introduces Reflective Monte Carlo Tree Search (R-MCTS) to improve autonomous agents in complex, multi-step decision-making tasks. By combining contrastive reflection and multi-agent debate, R-MCTS enables dynamic decision exploration and state evaluation for VLMs like GPT-4o. Through self-learning with R-MCTS-generated data, GPT-4o improves 6%-30% on tasks and achieves 97% of R-MCTS’s performance while using four times less compute, suggesting an effective approach for enhancing reasoning and planning in AI agents.*** <br>
    Oct 2, Columbia Uni and Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01748) “Improving Autonomous AI Agents with Reflective Tree Search and Self-Learning”. Autonomous agents have demonstrated significant potential in automating complex multistep decision-making tasks. However, even state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-4o, still fall short of human-level performance, particularly in intricate web environments and long-horizon planning tasks. To address these limitations, the study introduces Reflective Monte Carlo Tree Search (R-MCTS), a novel test-time algorithm designed to enhance the ability of AI agents, e.g., powered by GPT-4o, to explore decision space on the fly. R-MCTS extends traditional MCTS by 1) incorporating contrastive reflection, allowing agents to learn from past interactions and dynamically improve their search efficiency; and 2) using multi-agent debate to provide reliable state evaluation. Moreover, the study improves the agent's performance by fine-tuning GPT-4o through self-learning, using R-MCTS generated tree traversals without any human-provided labels. On the challenging VisualWebArena benchmark, the GPT-4o-based R-MCTS agent achieves a 6% to 30% relative improvement across various tasks compared to the previous state-of-the-art. Additionally, the study shows that the knowledge gained from test-time search can be effectively transferred back to GPT-4o via fine-tuning. The fine-tuned GPT-4o matches 97% of R-MCTS's performance while reducing compute usage by a factor of four at test time. Furthermore, qualitative results reveal that the fine-tuned GPT-4o model demonstrates the ability to explore the environment, evaluate a state, and backtrack to viable ones when it detects that the current state cannot lead to success. Moreover, the work demonstrates the compute scaling properties in both training - data collection with R-MCTS - and testing time. These results suggest a promising research direction to enhance VLMs' reasoning and planning capabilities for agentic applications via test-time search and self-learning. <br>

31. ***Nvidia's paper addresses the lack of comparable data for two key reward modeling approaches: Bradley-Terry style and Regression style. By adding preference annotations to complement existing ratings in their HelpSteer2 dataset, Nvidia enables the first head-to-head comparison of these models. They propose a novel method combining both approaches, leading to improved performance in alignment tasks with a new reward model (Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct). The study demonstrates strong results in RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) and releases the dataset and trained model for public use.*** <br>
    Oct 2, Nvidia published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01257) “HelpSteer2-Preference: Complementing Ratings with Preferences”. Reward models are critical for aligning models to follow instructions, and are typically trained following one of two popular paradigms: Bradley-Terry style or Regression style. However, there is a lack of evidence that either approach is better than the other, when adequately matched for data. This is primarily because these approaches require data collected in different (but incompatible) formats, meaning that adequately matched data is not available in existing public datasets. To tackle this problem, the study releases preference annotations (designed for Bradley-Terry training) to complement existing ratings (designed for Regression style training) in the HelpSteer2 dataset. To improve data interpretability, preference annotations are accompanied with human-written justifications. Using this data, the study conducts the first head-to-head comparison of Bradley-Terry and Regression models when adequately matched for data. Based on insights derived from such a comparison, the study proposes a novel approach to combine Bradley-Terry and Regression reward modeling. A Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct model tuned with this approach scores 94.1 on RewardBench, emerging top of more than 140 reward models as of 1 Oct 2024. The study also demonstrates the effectiveness of this reward model at aligning models to follow instructions in RLHF. The authors open-source this dataset (CC-BY-4.0 license) at https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer2 and openly release the trained Reward Model at https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Reward <br>

33. ***Enhancing credit assignment in complex reasoning tasks <br>
This paper introduces VinePPO, a new method that improves the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning algorithm, particularly for complex reasoning tasks in LLMs. The authors highlight the challenges faced by value networks in credit assignment and show that VinePPO consistently outperforms PPO and other baselines in fewer updates, using datasets like MATH and GSM8K. The work underscores the importance of better credit assignment mechanisms in reinforcement learning for LLMs.
Reward modeling comparison and combination <br>*** <br>
    Oct 2, Mila, Microsoft, McGill Uni, CIFAR, Uni de Montreal, and HEC Montreal published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01679) “VinePPO: Unlocking RL Potential For LLM Reasoning Through Refined Credit Assignment”. Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex reasoning tasks that require executing several complex steps before receiving any reward. Properly assigning credit to these steps is essential for enhancing model performance. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm used for LLM finetuning, employs value networks to tackle credit assignment. However, value networks face challenges in predicting the expected cumulative rewards accurately in complex reasoning tasks, often leading to high-variance updates and suboptimal performance. This work systematically evaluates the efficacy of value networks and reveal their significant shortcomings in reasoning-heavy LLM tasks, showing that they barely outperform a random baseline when comparing alternative steps. To address this, the work proposes VinePPO, a straightforward approach that leverages the flexibility of language environments to compute unbiased Monte Carlo-based estimates, bypassing the need for large value networks. This method consistently outperforms PPO and other RL-free baselines across MATH and GSM8K datasets with fewer gradient updates (up to 9x), less wall-clock time (up to 3.0x). These results emphasize the importance of accurate credit assignment in RL finetuning of LLM and demonstrate VinePPO's potential as a superior alternative. <br>

35. ***Zero-shot cross-lingual transfer using layer swapping <br>
UCLA's study presents a model merging approach aimed at improving cross-lingual transfer in large language models for mathematical reasoning tasks. The researchers fine-tune separate experts in math (English) and language and then merge their layers to enhance performance in target languages without in-language math data. The merged model improves by 10% across four languages on the MGSM benchmark, offering a simple and intuitive method for cross-lingual task adaptation.*** <br>
    Oct 2, UCLA published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01335) “Layer Swapping for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer in Large Language Models”. Model merging, such as model souping, is the practice of combining different models with the same architecture together without further training. This work presents a model merging methodology that addresses the difficulty of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for target tasks in non-English languages, where task-specific data is often unavailable. The study focuses on mathematical reasoning and without in-language math data, facilitate cross-lingual transfer by composing language and math capabilities. Starting from the same pretrained model, the work fine-tunes separate "experts" on math instruction data in English and on generic instruction data in the target language. The work then replaces the top and bottom transformer layers of the math expert directly with layers from the language expert, which consequently enhances math performance in the target language. The resulting merged models outperform the individual experts and other merging methods on the math benchmark, MGSM, by 10% across four major languages where math instruction data is scarce. In addition, this layer swapping is simple, inexpensive, and intuitive, as it is based on an interpretative analysis of the most important parameter changes during the fine-tuning of each expert. The ability to successfully re-compose LLMs for cross-lingual transfer in this manner opens up future possibilities to combine model expertise, create modular solutions, and transfer reasoning capabilities across languages all post hoc. <br>

37. ***Optimizing reasoning without overcoming probability sensitivity <br>
This paper examines OpenAI's o1 system, optimized for reasoning, and compares it to older LLMs. The study finds that while o1 shows significant improvements in complex tasks, it still shares the same sensitivity to probability as previous models. This sensitivity influences performance on low-probability tasks, highlighting a limitation in overcoming autoregressive trends in LLMs.*** <br>
    Oct 2, Yale Uni, OpenAI, Princeton Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01792) “When a language model is optimized for reasoning, does it still show embers of autoregression? An analysis of OpenAI o1”. In "Embers of Autoregression" (McCoy et al., 2023), the authors showed that several large language models (LLMs) have some important limitations that are attributable to their origins in next-word prediction. Here we investigate whether these issues persist with o1, a new system from OpenAI that differs from previous LLMs in that it is optimized for reasoning. The work finds that o1 substantially outperforms previous LLMs in many cases, with particularly large improvements on rare variants of common tasks (e.g., forming acronyms from the second letter of each word in a list, rather than the first letter). Despite these quantitative improvements, however, o1 still displays the same qualitative trends observed in previous systems. Specifically, o1 - like previous LLMs - is sensitive to the probability of examples and tasks, performing better and requiring fewer "thinking tokens" in high-probability settings than in low-probability ones. These results show that optimizing a language model for reasoning can mitigate but might not fully overcome the language model's probability sensitivity. <br>

39. ***Softmax limitations for out-of-distribution sharp decisions <br>
Google and the University of Oxford debunk the belief that softmax functions can robustly handle sharp decision-making in AI systems. They find that softmax circuits disperse with larger inputs, proving this through theoretical work. The authors propose adaptive temperature as a temporary fix but emphasize that softmax is fundamentally inadequate for tasks requiring sharp, consistent behavior on diverse inputs.*** <br>
    Oct 1, Google and Uni of Oxford published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01104) “softmax is not enough (for sharp out-of-distribution)”. A key property of reasoning systems is the ability to make sharp decisions on their input data. For contemporary AI systems, a key carrier of sharp behaviour is the softmax function, with its capability to perform differentiable query-key lookups. It is a common belief that the predictive power of networks leveraging softmax arises from "circuits" which sharply perform certain kinds of computations consistently across many diverse inputs. However, for these circuits to be robust, they would need to generalise well to arbitrary valid inputs. This paper dispels this myth: even for tasks as simple as finding the maximum key, any learned circuitry must disperse as the number of items grows at test time. The work attributes this to a fundamental limitation of the softmax function to robustly approximate sharp functions, prove this phenomenon theoretically, and propose adaptive temperature as an ad-hoc technique for improving the sharpness of softmax at inference time.   <br>

41. ***Detecting malicious prompts in vision-language models <br>
This paper introduces VLMGuard, a framework for detecting malicious prompts in vision-language models (VLMs) using unlabeled data. By estimating maliciousness scores and training a binary prompt classifier, VLMGuard outperforms existing methods without requiring extra human annotations. This approach highlights the practical need for reliable VLMs in real-world applications.*** <br>
    Oct 1, Uni of Wisconsin-Madison and Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00296) “VLMGuard: Defending VLMs against Malicious Prompts via Unlabeled Data”. Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential for contextual understanding of both visual and textual information. However, their vulnerability to adversarially manipulated inputs presents significant risks, leading to compromised outputs and raising concerns about the reliability in VLM-integrated applications. Detecting these malicious prompts is thus crucial for maintaining trust in VLM generations. A major challenge in developing a safeguarding prompt classifier is the lack of a large amount of labeled benign and malicious data. To address the issue, the work introduces VLMGuard, a novel learning framework that leverages the unlabeled user prompts in the wild for malicious prompt detection. These unlabeled prompts, which naturally arise when VLMs are deployed in the open world, consist of both benign and malicious information. To harness the unlabeled data, the study presents an automated maliciousness estimation score for distinguishing between benign and malicious samples within this unlabeled mixture, thereby enabling the training of a binary prompt classifier on top. Notably, the framework does not require extra human annotations, offering strong flexibility and practicality for real-world applications. Extensive experiment shows VLMGuard achieves superior detection results, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

43. ***Cross capabilities expose LLM performance weaknesses <br>
Meta and UIUC's research introduces CrossEval, a benchmark that tests LLMs' ability to handle tasks requiring multiple cross capabilities. The results show that LLMs tend to perform worse in these cross-capability tasks due to weaknesses in the least developed skills. The study suggests that addressing these weak links should be a research priority to improve LLMs' real-world utility in complex tasks.*** <br>
    Sep 30, Meta and UIUC published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19951) “Law of the Weakest Link: Cross Capabilities of Large Language Models”. The development and evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) have largely focused on individual capabilities. However, this overlooks the intersection of multiple abilities across different types of expertise that are often required for real-world tasks, which the authors term cross capabilities. To systematically explore this concept, the study first defines seven core individual capabilities and then pair them to form seven common cross capabilities, each supported by a manually constructed taxonomy. Building on these definitions, the study introduces CrossEval, a benchmark comprising 1,400 human-annotated prompts, with 100 prompts for each individual and cross capability. To ensure reliable evaluation, the study involves expert annotators to assess 4,200 model responses, gathering 8,400 human ratings with detailed explanations to serve as reference examples. The findings of the study reveal that, in both static evaluations and attempts to enhance specific abilities, current LLMs consistently exhibit the "Law of the Weakest Link," where cross-capability performance is significantly constrained by the weakest component. Specifically, across 58 cross-capability scores from 17 models, 38 scores are lower than all individual capabilities, while 20 fall between strong and weak, but closer to the weaker ability. These results highlight the under-performance of LLMs in cross-capability tasks, making the identification and improvement of the weakest capabilities a critical priority for future research to optimize performance in complex, multi-dimensional scenarios. <br>

45.	***Enhancing multimodal LLMs through data-centric training:  <br>MM1.5 is a significant upgrade of MM1. With one single set of weights, MM1.5 excels at (1) reading your charts, tables, and any text-rich images, (2) understanding visual prompts like points and boxes, providing grounded outputs, and (3) multi-image reasoning.*** <br>
Sep 30, Apple published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20566) “MM1.5: Methods, Analysis & Insights from Multimodal LLM Fine-tuning”. The paper presents MM1.5, a new family of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) designed to enhance capabilities in text-rich image understanding, visual referring and grounding, and multi-image reasoning. Building upon the MM1 architecture, MM1.5 adopts a data-centric approach to model training, systematically exploring the impact of diverse data mixtures across the entire model training lifecycle. This includes high-quality OCR data and synthetic captions for continual pre-training, as well as an optimized visual instruction-tuning data mixture for supervised fine-tuning. The models range from 1B to 30B parameters, encompassing both dense and mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants, and demonstrate that careful data curation and training strategies can yield strong performance even at small scales (1B and 3B). Additionally, the work introduces two specialized variants: MM1.5-Video, designed for video understanding, and MM1.5-UI, tailored for mobile UI understanding. Through extensive empirical studies and ablations, the authors provide detailed insights into the training processes and decisions that inform the final designs, offering valuable guidance for future research in MLLM development. <br>

24. ***Compositional generalization through skill mixing in LLMs <br>
Princeton University's study examines compositional generalization, specifically how LLMs can combine multiple skills unseen during training. Using a SKILL-MIX evaluation, the authors show that training on smaller skill combinations enhances performance in more complex tasks. The study underscores the potential of incorporating skill-rich texts to boost models' generalization abilities.*** <br>
    Sep 29, Princeton Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19808) “Can Models Learn Skill Composition from Examples”. As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly advanced, their ability to exhibit compositional generalization -- the capacity to combine learned skills in novel ways not encountered during training -- has garnered significant attention. This type of generalization, particularly in scenarios beyond training data, is also of great interest in the study of AI safety and alignment. A recent study introduced the SKILL-MIX evaluation, where models are tasked with composing a short paragraph demonstrating the use of a specified k-tuple of language skills. While small models struggled with composing even with k=3, larger models like GPT-4 performed reasonably well with k=5 and 6. This study employs a setup akin to SKILL-MIX to evaluate the capacity of smaller models to learn compositional generalization from examples. Utilizing a diverse set of language skills -- including rhetorical, literary, reasoning, theory of mind, and common sense -- GPT-4 was used to generate text samples that exhibit random subsets of k skills. Subsequent fine-tuning of 7B and 13B parameter models on these combined skill texts, for increasing values of k, revealed the following findings: (1) Training on combinations of k=2 and 3 skills results in noticeable improvements in the ability to compose texts with k=4 and 5 skills, despite models never having seen such examples during training. (2) When skill categories are split into training and held-out groups, models significantly improve at composing texts with held-out skills during testing despite having only seen training skills during fine-tuning, illustrating the efficacy of the training approach even with previously unseen skills. This study also suggests that incorporating skill-rich (potentially synthetic) text into training can substantially enhance the compositional capabilities of models. <br>

26. ***Data-augmented prediction for LLM-based classification <br>
The University of Arizona's paper introduces "Language Model Learning" (LML) for classification tasks, powered by a new method called Data-Augmented Prediction (DAP). LML uses LLMs to understand and classify data by referencing relevant datasets, achieving high accuracy without traditional data cleaning and feature engineering. The study shows that LML could outperform conventional ML models in many scenarios.*** <br>
    Sep 28, Uni of Arizona published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18957) “LML: Language Model Learning a Dataset for Data-Augmented Prediction”. This paper introduces a new approach to using Large Language Models (LLMs) for classification tasks, which are typically handled using Machine Learning (ML) models. Unlike ML models that rely heavily on data cleaning and feature engineering, this method streamlines the process using LLMs. This paper proposes a new concept called "Language Model Learning (LML)" powered by a new method called "Data-Augmented Prediction (DAP)". The classification is performed by LLMs using a method similar to humans manually exploring and understanding the data and deciding classifications using data as a reference. Training data is summarized and evaluated to determine the features that lead to the classification of each label the most. In the process of DAP, the system uses the data summary to automatically create a query, which is used to retrieve relevant rows from the dataset. A classification is generated by the LLM using data summary and relevant rows, ensuring satisfactory accuracy even with complex data. Usage of data summary and similar data in DAP ensures context-aware decision-making. The proposed method uses the words "Act as an Explainable Machine Learning Model" in the prompt to enhance the interpretability of the predictions by allowing users to review the logic behind each prediction. In some test cases, the system scored an accuracy above 90%, proving the effectiveness of the system and its potential to outperform conventional ML models in various scenarios.

    Sep 27, Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18475) “Data Analysis in the Era of Generative AI”. This paper explores the potential of AI-powered tools to reshape data analysis, focusing on design considerations and challenges. The paper explores how the emergence of large language and multimodal models offers new opportunities to enhance various stages of data analysis workflow by translating high-level user intentions into executable code, charts, and insights. The authors then examine human-centered design principles that facilitate intuitive interactions, build user trust, and streamline the AI-assisted analysis workflow across multiple apps. Finally, the paper discusses the research challenges that impede the development of these AI-based systems such as enhancing model capabilities, evaluating and benchmarking, and understanding end-user needs. <br>

32. ***Efficient low-bit quantization for large language models <br>
This paper introduces VPTQ, a new method for extremely low-bit quantization in LLMs, reducing memory and computational requirements while maintaining accuracy. The method uses vector quantization and second-order optimization, leading to significant improvements in quantization perplexity and model performance across several benchmarks. VPTQ offers a solution for deploying large-scale models more efficiently.*** <br>
    Sep 25, Microsoft and USTC published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17066) “VPTQ: Extreme Low-bit Vector Post-Training Quantization for Large Language Models”.  Scaling model size significantly challenges the deployment and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs). Due to the redundancy in LLM weights, recent research has focused on pushing weight-only quantization to extremely low-bit (even down to 2 bits). It reduces memory requirements, optimizes storage costs, and decreases memory bandwidth needs during inference. However, due to numerical representation limitations, traditional scalar-based weight quantization struggles to achieve such extreme low-bit. Recent research on Vector Quantization (VQ) for LLMs has demonstrated the potential for extremely low-bit model quantization by compressing vectors into indices using lookup tables. This paper introduces Vector Post-Training Quantization (VPTQ) for extremely low-bit quantization of LLMs. The study uses Second-Order Optimization to formulate the LLM VQ problem and guide the quantization algorithm design by solving the optimization. The work further refines the weights using Channel-Independent Second-Order Optimization for a granular VQ. In addition, by decomposing the optimization problem, the study proposes a brief and effective codebook initialization algorithm. The authors also extend VPTQ to support residual and outlier quantization, which enhances model accuracy and further compresses the model. The experimental results show that VPTQ reduces model quantization perplexity by 0.01-0.34 on LLaMA-2, 0.38-0.68 on Mistral-7B, 4.41-7.34 on LLaMA-3 over SOTA at 2-bit, with an average accuracy improvement of 0.79-1.5% on LLaMA-2, 1% on Mistral-7B, 11-22% on LLaMA-3 on QA tasks on average. We only utilize 10.4-18.6% of the quantization algorithm execution time, resulting in a 1.6-1.8times increase in inference throughput compared to SOTA. <br>

34. ***Scalable time series forecasting with Time-MoE <br>
Princeton University introduces Time-MoE, a mixture-of-experts model designed to improve time series forecasting while reducing computational costs. By pre-training on a large dataset spanning multiple domains, Time-MoE demonstrates superior performance compared to dense models, establishing it as a new state-of-the-art in time series forecasting.*** <br>
    Sep 24, Princeton Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16040) “Time-MoE: Billion-Scale Time Series Foundation Models with Mixture of Experts”. Deep learning for time series forecasting has seen significant advancements over the past decades. However, despite the success of large-scale pre-training in language and vision domains, pre-trained time series models remain limited in scale and operate at a high cost, hindering the development of larger capable forecasting models in real-world applications. In response, the study introduces Time-MoE, a scalable and unified architecture designed to pre-train larger, more capable forecasting foundation models while reducing inference costs. By leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, Time-MoE enhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for each prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model capacity. This allows Time-MoE to scale effectively without a corresponding increase in inference costs. Time-MoE comprises a family of decoder-only transformer models that operate in an auto-regressive manner and support flexible forecasting horizons with varying input context lengths. The study pre-trained these models on a newly introduced large-scale data Time-300B, which spans over 9 domains and encompassing over 300 billion time points. For the first time, the study scaled a time series foundation model up to 2.4 billion parameters, achieving significantly improved forecasting precision. Experimental results validate the applicability of scaling laws for training tokens and model size in the context of time series forecasting. Compared to dense models with the same number of activated parameters or equivalent computation budgets, the models consistently outperform them by large margin. These advancements position Time-MoE as a state-of-the-art solution for tackling real-world time series forecasting challenges with superior capability, efficiency, and flexibility. Code is available here.

   Sep 26, FPT Sofware AI Center published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16299) “HyperAgent: Generalist Software Engineering Agents to Solve Coding Tasks at Scale”. Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized software engineering (SE), demonstrating remarkable capabilities in various coding tasks. While recent efforts have produced autonomous software agents based on LLMs for end-to-end development tasks, these systems are typically designed for specific SE tasks.

7. ***Leadership Shakeup at OpenAI:   <br>Several key executives, including CTO Mira Murati, left OpenAI, raising concerns about leadership stability as the company pursues a controversial growth strategy. OpenAI is in talks for a new fundraising round, but the leadership exits leave CEO Sam Altman with fewer key leaders during this critical time of restructuring.*** <br><br>
   Sep 26, [according to CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/25/tech/openai-technology-chief-mira-murati-leaving/index.html?utm_source=neuralfrontier.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=meta-launches-orion-at-meta-connect&_bhlid=eab99b8c7f02019f455b5492c1bac68fde7e1f07), Three more execs out at OpenAI, including technology chief Mira Murati. Murati — who has been instrumental in the development of ChatGPT and the artificial intelligence image generator Dall-E — said Wednesday afternoon in a post on X that she is leaving the company. Shortly after, OpenAI’s Chief Research Officer Bob McGrew and Vice President of Research Barret Zoph also announced their decisions to exit. The Wednesday departures are just the latest in a string of executives who have recently left OpenAI. The leadership shakeup comes as the ChatGPT-maker attempts to forge a controversial path to growth, including making it easier to raise funds from investors and generate revenue. OpenAI is reportedly in talks about a new fundraising round that could value the firm at $150 billion, Bloomberg and others have reported. Later on Wednesday, Altman updated his post to acknowledge the exits of Zoph and McGrew. Taken together, the string of departures leave CEO Sam Altman without much of the leadership team that helped him rapidly grow OpenAI into an artificial intelligence juggernaut, and could consolidate power under Altman just as the company seeks to restructure. OpenAI did not immediately respond to a question about the timeline for Murati’s formal exit for the company, or if and when a new CTO would be announced. <br><br>

9. ***Cambridge and Google’s “DARE” for Visual Question Answering:   <br>The DARE study introduces a novel approach to image captioning using Image-like Retrieval and a Fusion Module to bridge the modality gap between text training and image inference. The approach significantly improves caption quality and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both image and video captioning tasks.*** <br><br>
    Sep 26, Uni of Cambridge and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18023) “DARE: Diverse Visual Question Answering with Robustness Evaluation”. Recent advancements in image captioning have explored text-only training methods to overcome the limitations of paired image-text data. However, existing text-only training methods often overlook the modality gap between using text data during training and employing images during inference. To address this issue, the study proposes a novel approach called Image-like Retrieval, which aligns text features with visually relevant features to mitigate the modality gap. The method further enhances the accuracy of generated captions by designing a Fusion Module that integrates retrieved captions with input features. Additionally, the study introduces a Frequency-based Entity Filtering technique that significantly improves caption quality. The authors integrate these methods into a unified framework, which the authors refer to as IFCap (Image-like Retrieval and Frequency-based Entity Filtering for Zero-shot Captioning). Through extensive experimentation, the straightforward yet powerful approach has demonstrated its efficacy, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin in both image captioning and video captioning compared to zero-shot captioning based on text-only training. <br><br>

11. ***Challenges in Vision-Language Compositionality for CLIP:   <br>The study reveals that current benchmarks overestimate improvements in compositionality for vision-language models like CLIP when trained with hard negatives. Including both hard positives and negatives in the training dataset improves model performance, suggesting the need for more robust benchmarks.*** <br><br>
    Sep 26, Uni of Washington, Uni of California Los Angeles and Allen Inst of AI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17958) on ECCV2024 “The Hard Positive Truth about Vision-Language Compositionality”. Several benchmarks have concluded that the best vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) are lacking in compositionality. Given an image, these benchmarks probe a model's ability to identify its associated caption amongst a set of compositional distractors. In response, a surge of recent proposals show improvements by finetuning CLIP with distractors as hard negatives. The investigations reveal that these improvements have, in fact, been significantly overstated -- because existing benchmarks do not probe whether finetuned vision-language models remain invariant to hard positives. By curating an evaluation dataset with 112,382 hard negatives and hard positives, the authors uncover that including hard positives decreases CLIP's performance by 12.9%, while humans perform effortlessly at 99%. CLIP finetuned with hard negatives results in an even larger decrease, up to 38.7%. With this finding, the study then produces a 1,775,259 image-text training set with both hard negative and hard positive captions. By training with both, the authors see improvements on existing benchmarks while simultaneously improving performance on hard positives, indicating a more robust improvement in compositionality. The work suggests the need for future research to rigorously test and improve CLIP's understanding of semantic relationships between related "positive" concepts. <br><br>

13. ***Larger Language Models Becoming Less Reliable:   <br>A Nature study shows that while scaling up and refining large language models (LLMs) improve certain capabilities, they also introduce new reliability issues. Larger models tend to provide plausible but incorrect answers more frequently and struggle with task stability. The findings call for a shift in AI development strategies.*** <br><br>
    Sep 25, Nature published a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07930-y.pdf) “Larger and more instructable language models become less reliable”. The prevailing methods to make large language models more powerful and amenable have been based on continuous scaling up (that is, increasing their size, data volume and computational resources) and bespoke shaping up (including post-filtering, fine tuning or use of human feedback). However, larger and more instructable large language models may have become less reliable. By studying the relationship between difficulty concordance, task avoidance and prompting stability of several language model families, the study shows that easy instances for human participants are also easy for the models, but scaled-up, shaped-up models do not secure areas of low difficulty in which either the model does not err or human supervision can spot the errors. The study also finds that early models often avoid user questions but scaled-up, shaped-up models tend to give an apparently sensible yet wrong answer much more often, including errors on difficult questions that human supervisors frequently overlook. Moreover, The study observes that stability to different natural phrasings of the same question is improved by scaling-up and shaping-up interventions, but pockets of variability persist across difficulty levels. These findings highlight the need for a fundamental shift in the design and development of general-purpose artificial intelligence, particularly in high-stakes areas for which a predictable distribution of errors is paramount. <br><br>

15. ***Molmo and PixMo: Open Multimodal Models:   <br>Molmo introduces a family of state-of-the-art multimodal models built entirely on open data and weights. It relies on human-annotated datasets for image captioning and outperforms both open and proprietary models like GPT-4o. Molmo emphasizes openness in model development, aiming to democratize advanced AI capabilities.*** <br><br>
    Sep 25, Allen Inst of AI and Uni of Washington published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17146) “Molmo and PixMo: Open Weights and Open Data for State-of-the-Art Multimodal Models”. Today's most advanced multimodal models remain proprietary. The strongest open-weight models rely heavily on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs to achieve good performance, effectively distilling these closed models into open ones. As a result, the community is still missing foundational knowledge about how to build performant VLMs from scratch. The study presents Molmo, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art in their class of openness. The key innovation is a novel, highly detailed image caption dataset collected entirely from human annotators using speech-based descriptions. To enable a wide array of user interactions, the study also introduces a diverse dataset mixture for fine-tuning that includes in-the-wild Q&A and innovative 2D pointing data. The success of the approach relies on careful choices for the model architecture details, a well-tuned training pipeline, and, most critically, the quality of the newly collected datasets, all of which will be released. The best-in-class 72B model within the Molmo family not only outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models but also compares favorably against proprietary systems like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini 1.5 on both academic benchmarks and human evaluation. The athors will be releasing all of the model weights, captioning and fine-tuning data, and source code in the near future.

It improves accuracy in large-scale document retrieval tasks by closing the semantic gaps that traditional methods and deep learning approaches struggle with.*** <br><br>
    Sep 25, Uni of Washington published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17383) “VectorSearch: Enhancing Document Retrieval with Semantic Embeddings and Optimized Search”. Traditional retrieval methods have been essential for assessing document similarity but struggle with capturing semantic nuances. Despite advancements in latent semantic analysis (LSA) and deep learning, achieving comprehensive semantic understanding and accurate retrieval remains challenging due to high dimensionality and semantic gaps. The above challenges call for new techniques to effectively reduce the dimensions and close the semantic gaps. To this end, the study proposes VectorSearch, which leverages advanced algorithms, embeddings, and indexing techniques for refined retrieval. By utilizing innovative multi-vector search operations and encoding searches with advanced language models, the approach significantly improves retrieval accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets show that VectorSearch outperforms baseline metrics, demonstrating its efficacy for large-scale retrieval tasks. <br><br>

21. ***Exploring OpenAI’s o1 in Medicine:   <br>OpenAI's o1 model shows promise in medical tasks, outperforming previous models like GPT-4 in reasoning and multilingual understanding across 37 datasets. However, the study also identifies weaknesses, such as hallucination and inconsistent multilingual abilities, highlighting areas for improvement in AI for medicine.*** <br><br>
    Sep 23, UC Santa Cruz, Uni of Edinburgh and NIH published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15277) “A Preliminary Study of o1 in Medicine: Are We Closer to an AI Doctor?”. Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various domains and tasks, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge in learning and cognition. The latest model, OpenAI's o1, stands out as the first LLM with an internalized chain-of-thought technique using reinforcement learning strategies. While it has demonstrated surprisingly strong capabilities on various general language tasks, its performance in specialized fields such as medicine remains unknown. To this end, this report provides a comprehensive exploration of o1 on different medical scenarios, examining 3 key aspects: understanding, reasoning, and multilinguality. Specifically, this evaluation encompasses 6 tasks using data from 37 medical datasets, including two newly constructed and more challenging question-answering (QA) tasks based on professional medical quizzes from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and The Lancet. These datasets offer greater clinical relevance compared to standard medical QA benchmarks such as MedQA, translating more effectively into real-world clinical utility. The analysis of o1 suggests that the enhanced reasoning ability of LLMs may (significantly) benefit their capability to understand various medical instructions and reason through complex clinical scenarios. Notably, o1 surpasses the previous GPT-4 in accuracy by an average of 6.2% and 6.6% across 19 datasets and two newly created complex QA scenarios. But meanwhile, the authors identify several weaknesses in both the model capability and the existing evaluation protocols, including hallucination, inconsistent multilingual ability, and discrepant metrics for evaluation. Raw data and model outputs is available at https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/o1_medicine/ for future research. <br><br>

23. ***Phantom LLVMs for Efficient AI:   <br>The Phantom LLVM family offers smaller, more efficient models with strong performance in vision-language tasks. By temporarily expanding hidden layers during self-attention, Phantom achieves the performance of larger models while maintaining a smaller physical size, offering a leading solution for efficient large models.*** <br><br>
    Sep 23, KAIST published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14713) “Phantom of Latent for Large Language and Vision Models”. The success of visual instruction tuning has accelerated the development of large language and vision models (LLVMs). Following the scaling laws of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), LLVMs either have further increased their sizes, reaching 26B, 34B, and even 80B parameters. While this increase in model size has yielded significant performance gains, it demands substantially more hardware resources for both training and inference. Consequently, there naturally exists a strong need for efficient LLVMs that achieve the performance of larger models while being smaller in size. To achieve this need, the paper presents a new efficient LLVM family with model sizes of 0.5B, 1.8B, 3.8B, and 7B parameters, Phantom, which significantly enhances learning capabilities within limited structures. By temporarily increasing the latent hidden dimension during multi-head self-attention (MHSA), the authors make LLVMs prepare to look and understand much more vision-language knowledge on the latent, without substantially increasing physical model sizes. To maximize its advantage, the authors introduce Phantom Optimization (PO) using both autoregressive supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO)-like concept, which effectively follows correct answers while eliminating incorrect and ambiguous ones. Phantom outperforms numerous larger open- and closed-source LLVMs, positioning itself as a leading solution in the landscape of efficient LLVMs. Code is available in https://github.com/ByungKwanLee/Phantom. <br><br>

25. ***Rethinking Machine Learning Principles for Scaling:   <br>A Google paper explores how traditional machine learning principles, such as regularization, are becoming less relevant in the era of scaling large models. The study highlights a phenomenon called “scaling law crossover,” where methods effective at smaller scales fail to generalize to larger ones, urging the development of new guiding principles for scaling.*** <br><br>
    Sep 23, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15156) “Rethinking Conventional Wisdom in Machine Learning: From Generalization to Scaling”. The remarkable success of large language pretraining and the discovery of scaling laws signify a paradigm shift in machine learning. Notably, the primary objective has evolved from minimizing generalization error to reducing approximation error, and the most effective strategy has transitioned from regularization (in a broad sense) to scaling up models. This raises a critical question: Do the established principles that proved successful in the generalization-centric era remain valid in this new era of scaling? This paper examines several influential regularization-based principles that may no longer hold true in the scaling-centric, large language model (LLM) era. These principles include explicit L2 regularization and implicit regularization through small batch sizes and large learning rates. Additionally, the study identifies a new phenomenon termed “scaling law crossover,” where two scaling curves intersect at a certain scale, implying that methods effective at smaller scales may not generalize to larger ones. Together, these observations highlight two fundamental questions within this new paradigm: 1) Guiding Principles for Scaling: If regularization is no longer the primary guiding principle for model design, what new principles are emerging to guide scaling? 2) Model Comparison at Scale: How to reliably and effectively compare models at the scale where only a single experiment is feasible? <br><br>

27. ***Improving AI Safety with Backtracking:   <br>A new method called backtracking, introduced by Meta and CMU, allows language models to recover from unsafe text generation. By incorporating a [RESET] token, models trained with this method significantly improve safety without losing helpfulness, offering better protection against adversarial attacks.*** <br><br>
    Sep 22, Meta and CMU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14586) “Backtracking Improves Generation Safety”. Text generation has a fundamental limitation almost by definition: there is no taking back tokens that have been generated, even when they are clearly problematic. In the context of language model safety, when a partial unsafe generation is produced, language models by their nature tend to happily keep on generating similarly unsafe additional text. This is in fact how safety alignment of frontier models gets circumvented in the wild, despite great efforts in improving their safety. Deviating from the paradigm of approaching safety alignment as prevention (decreasing the probability of harmful responses), the paper proposes backtracking, a technique that allows language models to "undo" and recover from their own unsafe generation through the introduction of a special [RESET] token. The method can be incorporated into either SFT or DPO training to optimize helpfulness and harmlessness. The work shows that models trained to backtrack are consistently safer than baseline models: backtracking Llama-3-8B is four times more safe than the baseline model (6.1\% → 1.5\%) in the evaluations without regression in helpfulness. The method additionally provides protection against four adversarial attacks including an adaptive attack, despite not being trained to do so. <br><br>

29. ***Mitigating Reward Hacking in AI Models:   <br>A new framework introduced by Google and UIUC improves reward model training by disentangling relevant preferences from artifacts like response length. This robust reward model enhances AI's alignment with human preferences, significantly improving the performance of reward-based policies in large-scale AI systems.*** <br><br>
    Sep 20, Google, UIUC et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13156) “RRM: Robust Reward Model Training Mitigates Reward Hacking”. Reward models (RMs) play a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, traditional RM training, which relies on response pairs tied to specific prompts, struggles to disentangle prompt-driven preferences from prompt-independent artifacts, such as response length and format. This work exposes a fundamental limitation of current RM training methods, where RMs fail to effectively distinguish between contextual signals and irrelevant artifacts when determining preferences. To address this, the work introduces a causal framework that learns preferences independent of these artifacts and propose a novel data augmentation technique designed to eliminate them. Extensive experiments show that the approach successfully filters out undesirable artifacts, yielding a more robust reward model (RRM). The RRM improves the performance of a pairwise reward model trained on Gemma-2-9b-it, on RewardBench, increasing accuracy from 80.61% to 84.15%. Additionally, the authors train two DPO policies using both the RM and RRM, demonstrating that the RRM significantly enhances DPO-aligned policies, improving MT-Bench scores from 7.27 to 8.31 and length-controlled win-rates in AlpacaEval-2 from 33.46% to 52.49%. <br><br>

31. ***LLMs' Role in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  <br>A paper from Harvard and Google introduces "FRAMES" to evaluate LLMs' performance in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The dataset tests LLMs' factual response accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and reasoning ability through complex multi-hop questions. Current state-of-the-art LLMs show improved accuracy from 0.40 to 0.66 with multi-step retrieval, but there remains significant room for improvement in creating robust RAG systems.*** <br><br>
    Sep 20, Harvard Uni and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12941) “Fact, Fetch, and Reason: A Unified Evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation”. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant performance improvements across various cognitive tasks. An emerging application is using LLMs to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities. These systems require LLMs to understand user queries, retrieve relevant information, and synthesize coherent and accurate responses. Given the increasing real-world deployment of such systems, comprehensive evaluation becomes crucial. To this end, the study proposes FRAMES (Factuality, Retrieval, And reasoning MEasurement Set), a high-quality evaluation dataset designed to test LLMs' ability to provide factual responses, assess retrieval capabilities, and evaluate the reasoning required to generate final answers. While previous work has provided datasets and benchmarks to evaluate these abilities in isolation, FRAMES offers a unified framework that provides a clearer picture of LLM performance in end-to-end RAG scenarios. The dataset comprises challenging multi-hop questions that require the integration of information from multiple sources. The authors present baseline results demonstrating that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with this task, achieving 0.40 accuracy with no retrieval. The accuracy is significantly improved with the proposed multi-step retrieval pipeline, achieving an accuracy of 0.66 (>50% improvement). The authors hope the work will help bridge evaluation gaps and assist in developing more robust and capable RAG systems. <br><br>

33. ***LLMs' Planning Abilities Examined via PlanBench  <br>Arizona State University evaluates OpenAI’s "o1" (Strawberry) model, which claims to improve LLMs' planning capabilities, a core competence in AI. Despite surpassing previous models in planning tasks on the PlanBench benchmark, o1 still falls short of fully solving the benchmark's challenges. This raises questions about the efficiency, accuracy, and reliability of such systems before deployment.*** <br><br>
    Sep 20, Arizona State Uni published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13373) “LLMs Still Can't Plan; Can LRMs? A Preliminary Evaluation of OpenAI's o1 on PlanBench”. The ability to plan a course of action that achieves a desired state of affairs has long been considered a core competence of intelligent agents and has been an integral part of AI research since its inception. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), there has been considerable interest in the question of whether or not they possess such planning abilities. PlanBench, an extensible benchmark developed in 2022, soon after the release of GPT3, has remained an important tool for evaluating the planning abilities of LLMs. Despite the slew of new private and open source LLMs since GPT3, progress on this benchmark has been surprisingly slow. OpenAI claims that their recent o1 (Strawberry) model has been specifically constructed and trained to escape the normal limitations of autoregressive LLMs--making it a new kind of model: a Large Reasoning Model (LRM). Using this development as a catalyst, this paper takes a comprehensive look at how well current LLMs and new LRMs do on PlanBench. While o1's performance is a quantum improvement on the benchmark, outpacing the competition, it is still far from saturating it. This improvement also brings to the fore questions about accuracy, efficiency, and guarantees which must be considered before deploying such systems. <br><br>

35. ***Michelangelo's Long-Context Evaluation Framework  <br>Google introduces Michelangelo, a synthetic evaluation for testing LLMs' long-context reasoning abilities through a novel framework called Latent Structure Queries (LSQ). The evaluation focuses on how well models handle large, complex contexts by identifying hidden structures. The study demonstrates that LLMs show significant potential in long-context processing, but there remains much room for improvement.*** <br><br>
    Sep 20, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12640) “Michelangelo: Long Context Evaluations Beyond Haystacks via Latent Structure Queries”. The paper introduces Michelangelo: a minimal, synthetic, and unleaked long-context reasoning evaluation for large language models which is also easy to automatically score. This evaluation is derived via a novel, unifying framework for evaluations over arbitrarily long contexts which measure the model's ability to do more than retrieve a single piece of information from its context. The central idea of the Latent Structure Queries framework (LSQ) is to construct tasks which require a model to “chisel away” the irrelevant information in the context, revealing a latent structure in the context. To verify a model's understanding of this latent structure, the study queries the model for details of the structure. Using LSQ, the authors produce three diagnostic long-context evaluations across code and natural-language domains intended to provide a stronger signal of long-context language model capabilities. The authors perform evaluations on several state-of-the-art models and demonstrate both that a) the proposed evaluations are high-signal and b) that there is significant room for improvement in synthesizing long-context information. <br><br>

37. ***OpenAI O1’s Use of External SAT Solvers  <br>The University of Florence analyzes OpenAI’s O1-preview model for solving K-SAT problems. Results indicate that the model often relies on external SAT solvers rather than solving the problems internally. The study critiques the model for occasionally outputting incorrect solutions and questions whether the model exhibits true intelligence or is making random guesses.*** <br><br>
    Sep 20, Uni of Florence published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11232) “Fast Analysis of the OpenAI O1-Preview Model in Solving Random K-SAT Problem: Does the LLM Solve the Problem Itself or Call an External SAT Solver?” The manuscript  presents an analysis on the performance of OpenAI O1-preview model in solving random K-SAT instances for K∈ 2, 3, 4 as a function of α = M/N where M is the number of clauses and N is the number of variables of the satisfiable problem. The study shows that the model can call an external SAT solver to solve the instances, rather than solving them directly. Despite using external solvers, the model reports incorrect assignments as output. Moreover, the study proposes and presents an analysis to quantify whether the OpenAI O1-preview model demonstrates a spark of intelligence or merely makes random guesses when outputting an assignment for a Boolean satisfiability problem. <br><br>

39. ***Evaluating Foundation Models' Understanding of Emotions  <br>A study by Stanford and UT Austin introduces a framework to evaluate AI's affective cognition abilities, exploring how models infer emotions and scenarios. Using diverse scenarios, the study finds that foundation models, including GPT-4, match or surpass human agreement in many cases. The models perform well in understanding emotional dynamics, especially when using chain-of-thought reasoning, suggesting a human-like grasp of emotions.*** <br><br>
    Sep 19, Stanford Uni and Uni of Texas Austin published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11733) “Human-like Affective Cognition in Foundation Models”. Understanding emotions is fundamental to human interaction and experience. Humans easily infer emotions from situations or facial expressions, situations from emotions, and do a variety of other affective cognition. How adept is modern AI at these inferences? The study introduces an evaluation framework for testing affective cognition in foundation models. Starting from psychological theory, the study generates 1,280 diverse scenarios exploring relationships between appraisals, emotions, expressions, and outcomes. The authors evaluate the abilities of foundation models (GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemini-1.5-Pro) and humans (N = 567) across carefully selected conditions. Experimental results show foundation models tend to agree with human intuitions, matching or exceeding interparticipant agreement. In some conditions, models are “superhuman” -- they better predict modal human judgements than the average human. All models benefit from chain-of-thought reasoning. This suggests foundation models have acquired a human-like understanding of emotions and their influence on beliefs and behavior. <br><br>

41. ***Exploring Safety Gaps in Fine-tuned LLMs  <br>This paper investigates how fine-tuning LLMs on downstream tasks like translation and code generation compromises their safety guardrails. The results show significant safety degradation, with harmful responses reaching 73-92% in some cases. The authors propose a new multitask safety dataset that reduces these risks, highlighting the need for robust, cross-task safety measures in LLM development.*** <br><br>
    Sep 18, Lahore Uni, NYU and Meta published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15361) “Multitask Mayhem: Unveiling and Mitigating Safety Gaps in LLMs Fine-tuning”. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their adoption across a wide range of tasks, ranging from code generation to machine translation and sentiment analysis, etc. Red teaming/Safety alignment efforts show that fine-tuning models on benign (non-harmful) data could compromise safety. However, it remains unclear to what extent this phenomenon is influenced by different variables, including fine-tuning task, model calibrations, etc. This paper explores the task-wise safety degradation due to fine-tuning on downstream tasks such as summarization, code generation, translation, and classification across various calibration. Experimental results reveal that: 1) Fine-tuning LLMs for code generation and translation leads to the highest degradation in safety guardrails. 2) LLMs generally have weaker guardrails for translation and classification, with 73-92% of harmful prompts answered, across baseline and other calibrations, falling into one of two concern categories. 3) Current solutions, including guards and safety tuning datasets, lack cross-task robustness. To address these issues, the paper developed a new multitask safety dataset effectively reducing attack success rates across a range of tasks without compromising the model's overall helpfulness. The work underscores the need for generalized alignment measures to ensure safer and more robust models. <br><br>

43. ***Improving Error Analysis with SemSlicer  <br>Carnegie Mellon introduces SemSlicer, a framework for semantic data slicing that helps identify systematic issues in machine learning models. The framework uses LLMs to annotate datasets, offering more flexible and accurate slicing than traditional methods. SemSlicer helps practitioners pinpoint underperforming slices and uncover systematic model errors efficiently.*** <br><br>
    Sep 14, CMU published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09261) “What Is Wrong with My Model? Identifying Systematic Problems with Semantic Data Slicing”. Machine learning models make mistakes, yet sometimes it is difficult to identify the systematic problems behind the mistakes. Practitioners engage in various activities, including error analysis, testing, auditing, and red-teaming, to form hypotheses of what can go (or has gone) wrong with their models. To validate these hypotheses, practitioners employ data slicing to identify relevant examples. However, traditional data slicing is limited by available features and programmatic slicing functions. This work proposes SemSlicer, a framework that supports semantic data slicing, which identifies a semantically coherent slice, without the need for existing features. SemSlicer uses Large Language Models to annotate datasets and generate slices from any user-defined slicing criteria. The work shows that SemSlicer generates accurate slices with low cost, allows flexible trade-offs between different design dimensions, reliably identifies under-performing data slices, and helps practitioners identify useful data slices that reflect systematic problems.

1. ***Apple's Exploration of HyperCloning for Efficient LLM Training:  <br>Apple introduced "HyperCloning," a method to speed up large language model (LLM) training by initializing large models using pre-trained smaller models. This technique preserves the smaller model's predictive accuracy while reducing the GPU hours required for large-scale pre-training.*** <br><br>
   Sep 20, Apple published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12903) “Scaling Smart: Accelerating Large Language Model Pre-training with Small Model Initialization”. The pre-training phase of language models often begins with randomly initialized parameters. With the current trends in scaling models, training their large number of parameters can be extremely slow and costly. In contrast, small language models are less expensive to train, but they often cannot achieve the accuracy of large models. The study explores an intriguing idea to connect these two different regimes: Can we develop a method to initialize large language models using smaller pre-trained models? Will such initialization bring any benefits in terms of training time and final accuracy? This paper introduces HyperCloning, a method that can expand the parameters of a pre-trained language model to those of a larger model with increased hidden dimensions. The method ensures that the larger model retains the functionality of the smaller model. As a result, the larger model already inherits the predictive power and accuracy of the smaller model before the training starts. The study demonstrates that training such an initialized model results in significant savings in terms of GPU hours required for pre-training large language models.

3. ***RLHF Leading to Misleading Human Perceptions:  <br>A joint study by several institutions revealed that Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) might worsen LLM errors by making them more convincing to humans. This issue, termed "U-SOPHISTRY," shows that RLHF increases false positive rates and highlights a need for improved human-alignment methods.*** <br><br>
   Sep 19, Tsinhua Uni, UC Berkeley, Anthropic, NYU, and George Washington Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12822) “Language Models Learn to Mislead Humans via RLHF”. Language models (LMs) can produce errors that are hard to detect for humans, especially when the task is complex. RLHF, the most popular post-training method, may exacerbate this problem: to achieve higher rewards, LMs might get better at convincing humans that they are right even when they are wrong. This work studies this phenomenon under a standard RLHF pipeline, calling it "U-SOPHISTRY" since it is Unintended by model developers. Specifically, the work askes time-constrained (e.g., 3-10 minutes) human subjects to evaluate the correctness of model outputs and calculate humans' accuracy against gold labels. On a question-answering task (QuALITY) and programming task (APPS), RLHF makes LMs better at convincing the subjects but not at completing the task correctly. RLHF also makes the model harder to evaluate: the subjects' false positive rate increases by 24.1% on QuALITY and 18.3% on APPS. Finally, the study shows that probing, a state-of-the-art approach for detecting Intended Sophistry (e.g. backdoored LMs), does not generalize to U-SOPHISTRY. The experimental results highlight an important failure mode of RLHF and call for more research in assisting humans to align them.

5. ***Google's SCoRe Improves Self-Correction in LLMs:  <br>Google developed "SCoRe," a reinforcement learning method that enhances an LLM's self-correction ability. It improves performance on math and programming tasks without relying on external models, showing significant gains in the Gemini model family.*** <br><br>
   Sep 19, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12917) “Training Language Models to Self-Correct via Reinforcement Learning”. Self-correction is a highly desirable capability of large language models (LLMs), yet it has consistently been found to be largely ineffective in modern LLMs. Existing approaches for training self-correction either require multiple models or rely on a more capable model or other forms of supervision. To this end, the study develops a multi-turn online reinforcement learning (RL) approach, SCoRe, that significantly improves an LLM's self-correction ability using entirely self-generated data. To build SCoRe, the study first shows that variants of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on offline model-generated correction traces are insufficient for instilling self-correction behavior. In particular, the authors observe that training via SFT either suffers from a distribution mismatch between the training data and the model's own responses or implicitly prefers only a certain mode of correction behavior that is often not effective at test time. SCoRe addresses these challenges by training under the model's own distribution of self-generated correction traces and using appropriate regularization to steer the learning process into learning a self-correction strategy that is effective at test time as opposed to simply fitting high-reward responses for a given prompt. This regularization prescribes running a first phase of RL on a base model to generate a policy initialization that is less susceptible to collapse and then using a reward bonus to amplify self-correction during training. When applied to Gemini 1.0 Pro and 1.5 Flash models, the authors find that SCoRe achieves state-of-the-art self-correction performance, improving the base models' self-correction by 15.6% and 9.1% respectively on the MATH and HumanEval benchmarks.

7. ***Moshi's Innovation in Real-Time Spoken Dialogue:  <br>The "Moshi" framework eliminates the traditional speech pipeline's latency and segmentation issues by directly generating speech-to-speech dialogue. It models user and system speech streams in parallel, enabling real-time, full-duplex conversation with minimal delay.*** <br><br>
   Sep 18, Kyutai published a [paper](https://kyutai.org/Moshi.pdf) “Moshi: a speech-text foundation model for real-time dialogue”. The paper introduces Moshi, a speech-text foundation model and full-duplex spoken dialogue framework. Current systems for spoken dialogue rely on pipelines of independent components, namely voice activity detection, speech recognition, textual dialogue and text-to-speech. Such frameworks cannot emulate the experience of real conversations. First, their complexity induces a latency of several seconds between interactions. Second, text being the intermediate modality for dialogue, non-linguistic information that modifies meaning— such as emotion or non-speech sounds— is lost in the interaction. Finally, they rely on a segmentation into speaker turns, which does not take into account overlapping speech, interruptions and interjections. Moshi solves these independent issues altogether by casting spoken dialogue as speech-to-speech generation. Starting from a text language model backbone, Moshi generates speech as tokens from the residual quantizer of a neural audio codec, while modeling separately its own speech and that of the user into parallel streams. This allows for the removal of explicit speaker turns, and the modeling of arbitrary conversational dynamics. The authors moreover extend the hierarchical semantic-to-acoustic token generation of previous work to first predict time-aligned text tokens as a prefix to audio tokens. Not only this “Inner Monologue” method significantly improves the linguistic quality of generated speech, but the paper also illustrates how it can provide streaming speech recognition and text-to-speech. The resulting model is the first real-time full-duplex spoken large language model, with a theoretical latency of 160ms, 200ms in practice, and is available at github.com/kyutai-labs/moshi.

9. ***Chain-of-Thought Benefits Limited to Symbolic Tasks:  <br>A meta-analysis indicated that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting mainly boosts performance in math and symbolic reasoning tasks. It has limited benefits in other areas, suggesting selective application and a need for new paradigms in LLM reasoning tasks.*** <br><br>
    Sep 18, Uni of Texas at Austin, Johns Hopkins Uni and Princeton Uni published a [paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.12183) “To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic reasoning”. Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of tasks is this extra “thinking” really helpful? To analyze this, the authors conducted a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Experimental results show that CoT gives strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic operations and reasoning. Following this finding, the authors analyze the behavior of CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. The results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation across the whole range of LLM applications.

11. ***CORE-Bench for Measuring AI Agent Reproducibility:  <br>Princeton introduced "CORE-Bench," a benchmark designed to assess AI agents' ability to reproduce scientific results. The benchmark reveals substantial gaps in current agents' reproducibility capabilities, calling for improvements in research agents' accuracy.*** <br><br>
    Sep 17, Princeton Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11363) “CORE-Bench: Fostering the Credibility of Published Research Through a Computational Reproducibility Agent Benchmark”. AI agents have the potential to aid users on a variety of consequential tasks, including conducting scientific research. To spur the development of useful agents, researchers need benchmarks that are challenging, but more crucially, directly correspond to real-world tasks of interest. This paper introduces such a benchmark, designed to measure the accuracy of AI agents in tackling a crucial yet surprisingly challenging aspect of scientific research: computational reproducibility. This task, fundamental to the scientific process, involves reproducing the results of a study using the provided code and data. This study introduces CORE-Bench (Computational Reproducibility Agent Benchmark), a benchmark consisting of 270 tasks based on 90 scientific papers across three disciplines (computer science, social science, and medicine). Tasks in CORE-Bench consist of three difficulty levels and include both language-only and vision-language tasks. The authors provide an evaluation system to measure the accuracy of agents in a fast and parallelizable way, saving days of evaluation time for each run compared to a sequential implementation. The study evaluated two baseline agents: the general-purpose AutoGPT and a task-specific agent called CORE-Agent. The authors tested both variants using two underlying language models: GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini. The best agent achieved an accuracy of 21% on the hardest task, showing the vast scope for improvement in automating routine scientific tasks. Having agents that can reproduce existing work is a necessary step towards building agents that can conduct novel research and could verify and improve the performance of other research agents.

They integrate multimodal and text-only training, enhancing performance across math, coding, and OCR tasks.*** <br><br>
    Sep 17, Nvidia published a paper “NVLM: Open Frontier-Class Multimodal LLMs”. The [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11402) introduces NVLM 1.0, a family of frontier-class multimodal large language models (LLMs) that achieve state-of-the-art results on vision-language tasks, rivaling the leading proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-access models (e.g., Llama 3-V 405B and InternVL 2). Remarkably, NVLM 1.0 shows improved text-only performance over its LLM backbone after multimodal training. In terms of model design, the study performs a comprehensive comparison between decoder-only multimodal LLMs (e.g., LLaVA) and cross-attention-based models (e.g., Flamingo). Based on the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, the study proposes a novel architecture that enhances both training efficiency and multimodal reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, the authors introduce a 1-D tile-tagging design for tile-based dynamic high-resolution images, which significantly boosts performance on multimodal reasoning and OCR-related tasks. Regarding training data, the authors meticulously curate and provide detailed information on the multimodal pretraining and supervised fine-tuning datasets. The findings indicate that dataset quality and task diversity are more important than scale, even during the pretraining phase, across all architectures. Notably, the study develops production-grade multimodality for the NVLM-1.0 models, enabling them to excel in vision-language tasks while maintaining and even improving text-only performance compared to their LLM backbones. To achieve this, the authors craft and integrate a high-quality text-only dataset into multimodal training, alongside a substantial amount of multimodal math and reasoning data, leading to enhanced math and coding capabilities across modalities. To advance research in the field, the model weights and the code will be released at https://nvlm-project.github.io/.

15. ***Improved Diffusion Models for Depth and Normal Estimation:  <br>Researchers demonstrated that correcting inefficiencies in diffusion models significantly boosts their performance in depth and normal estimation tasks, achieving results that rival state-of-the-art models with much faster inference times.*** <br><br>
    Sep 17, RWTH Aachen Uni and Eindhoven Uni of Tech published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11355) “Fine-Tuning Image-Conditional Diffusion Models is Easier than You Think”. Recent work showed that large diffusion models can be reused as highly precise monocular depth estimators by casting depth estimation as an image-conditional image generation task. While the proposed model achieved state-of-the-art results, high computational demands due to multi-step inference limited its use in many scenarios. This paper shows that the perceived inefficiency was caused by a flaw in the inference pipeline that has so far gone unnoticed. The fixed model performs comparably to the best previously reported configuration while being more than 200times faster. To optimize for downstream task performance, the authors perform end-to-end fine-tuning on top of the single-step model with task-specific losses and get a deterministic model that outperforms all other diffusion-based depth and normal estimation models on common zero-shot benchmarks. The authors surprisingly find that this fine-tuning protocol also works directly on Stable Diffusion and achieves comparable performance to current state-of-the-art diffusion-based depth and normal estimation models, calling into question some of the conclusions drawn from prior works. [Code is here](https://github.com/VisualComputingInstitute/diffusion-e2e-ft).

17. ***Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT) Optimizes Transformer Efficiency:  <br>The introduction of the Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT) replaces traditional MLP layers with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to improve deep learning models' performance and efficiency, solving key challenges in scaling transformers.*** <br><br>
    Sep 16, National Uni of Singapore published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10594) “Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer”. Transformers stand as the cornerstone of mordern deep learning. Traditionally, these models rely on multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers to mix the information between channels. This paper introduces the Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), a novel architecture that replaces MLP layers with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers to enhance the expressiveness and performance of the model. Integrating KANs into transformers, however, is no easy feat, especially when scaled up. Specifically, the authors identify three key challenges: (C1) Base function. The standard B-spline function used in KANs is not optimized for parallel computing on modern hardware, resulting in slower inference speeds. (C2) Parameter and Computation Inefficiency. KAN requires a unique function for each input-output pair, making the computation extremely large. (C3) Weight initialization. The initialization of weights in KANs is particularly challenging due to their learnable activation functions, which are critical for achieving convergence in deep neural networks. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, the authors propose three key solutions: (S1) Rational basis, which replaces B-spline functions with rational functions to improve compatibility with modern GPUs. By implementing this in CUDA, the authors achieve faster computations. (S2) Group KAN, which shares the activation weights through a group of neurons, to reduce the computational load without sacrificing performance. (S3) Variance-preserving initialization, which carefully initializes the activation weights to make sure that the activation variance is maintained across layers. With these designs, KAT scales effectively and readily outperforms traditional MLP-based transformers.

19. ***AgentTorch Enhances Agent-Based Modeling with LLMs:  <br>MIT's AgentTorch scales agent-based models (ABMs) to millions of agents, using LLMs to simulate complex behaviors. Applied to COVID-19, it demonstrates how adaptive agents can improve policy design by simulating realistic population behaviors.*** <br><br>
    Sep 14, MIT published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10568) “On the limits of agency in agent-based models”. Agent-based modeling (ABM) seeks to understand the behavior of complex systems by simulating a collection of agents that act and interact within an environment. Their practical utility requires capturing realistic environment dynamics and adaptive agent behavior while efficiently simulating million-size populations. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to enhance ABMs by using LLMs as agents with further potential to capture adaptive behavior. However, the computational infeasibility of using LLMs for large populations has hindered their widespread adoption. This paper introduces AgentTorch -- a framework that scales ABMs to millions of agents while capturing high-resolution agent behavior using LLMs. The researhers benchmark the utility of LLMs as ABM agents, exploring the trade-off between simulation scale and individual agency. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a case study, the study demonstrates how AgentTorch can simulate 8.4 million agents representing New York City, capturing the impact of isolation and employment behavior on health and economic outcomes. The authors compare the performance of different agent architectures based on heuristic and LLM agents in predicting disease waves and unemployment rates. Furthermore, the study showcases AgentTorch's capabilities for retrospective, counterfactual, and prospective analyses, highlighting how adaptive agent behavior can help overcome the limitations of historical data in policy design. AgentTorch is an open-source project actively being used for policy-making and scientific discovery around the world. The framework is available here: github.com/AgentTorch/AgentTorch.

21. ***AI-Driven Dialogues Reduce Conspiracy Beliefs:  <br>A study using GPT-4 Turbo for personalized dialogues showed a 20% reduction in conspiracy beliefs. The effects persisted for two months and generalized across various conspiracy theories, highlighting the potential of AI-driven interventions.*** <br><br>
    Sep 13, MIT, Cornell Uni and American Uni published a [paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq1814) on Science “Durably reducing conspiracy beliefs through dialogues with AI”. Conspiracy theory beliefs are notoriously persistent. Influential hypotheses propose that they fulfill important psychological needs, thus resisting counterevidence. Yet previous failures in correcting conspiracy beliefs may be due to counterevidence being insufficiently compelling and tailored. To evaluate this possibility, the researchers leveraged developments in generative artificial intelligence and engaged 2190 conspiracy believers in personalized evidence-based dialogues with GPT-4 Turbo. The intervention reduced conspiracy belief by ~20%. The effect remained 2 months later, generalized across a wide range of conspiracy theories, and occurred even among participants with deeply entrenched beliefs. Although the dialogues focused on a single conspiracy, they nonetheless diminished belief in unrelated conspiracies and shifted conspiracy-related behavioral intentions. These findings suggest that many conspiracy theory believers can revise their views if presented with sufficiently compelling evidence.

23. ***AI-Edited Visuals Increase False Memories:  <br>Research indicated that AI-edited images and videos significantly increase false recollections in participants, with the strongest effect observed in AI-generated videos of AI-edited images. This raises concerns about the ethical and societal impacts of AI-altered visuals.*** <br><br>
    Sep 13, MIT, UC Irvine et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08895) “Synthetic Human Memories: AI-Edited Images and Videos Can Implant False Memories and Distort Recollection”. AI is increasingly used to enhance images and videos, both intentionally and unintentionally. As AI editing tools become more integrated into smartphones, users can modify or animate photos into realistic videos. This study examines the impact of AI-altered visuals on false memories--recollections of events that didn't occur or deviate from reality. In a pre-registered study, 200 participants were divided into four conditions of 50 each. Participants viewed original images, completed a filler task, then saw stimuli corresponding to their assigned condition: unedited images, AI-edited images, AI-generated videos, or AI-generated videos of AI-edited images. AI-edited visuals significantly increased false recollections, with AI-generated videos of AI-edited images having the strongest effect (2.05x compared to control). Confidence in false memories was also highest for this condition (1.19x compared to control). The authors discuss potential applications in HCI, such as therapeutic memory reframing, and challenges in ethical, legal, political, and societal domains.

25. ***AI-LieDar Framework for Truth-Utility Conflicts in LLM Agents:  <br>A study developed AI-LieDar, a framework to explore how LLMs navigate truthfulness-utility trade-offs in multi-turn conversations. Results showed that LLMs are truthful less than 50% of the time, and truth-steering remains a challenge.*** <br><br>
    Sep 13, CMU, Uni of Michigan, and Allen Inst for AI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09013) “AI-LieDar: Examine the Trade-off Between Utility and Truthfulness in LLM Agents”. To be safely and successfully deployed, LLMs must simultaneously satisfy truthfulness and utility goals. Yet, often these two goals compete (e.g., an AI agent assisting a used car salesman selling a car with flaws), partly due to ambiguous or misleading user instructions. The paper proposes AI-LieDar, a framework to study how LLM-based agents navigate scenarios with utility-truthfulness conflicts in a multi-turn interactive setting. The authors design a set of realistic scenarios where language agents are instructed to achieve goals that are in conflict with being truthful during a multi-turn conversation with simulated human agents. To evaluate the truthfulness at large scale, the study develops a truthfulness detector inspired by psychological literature to assess the agents' responses. The experiment demonstrates that all models are truthful less than 50% of the time, although truthfulness and goal achievement (utility) rates vary across models. The study further tests the steerability of LLMs towards truthfulness, finding that models follow malicious instructions to deceive, and even truth-steered models can still lie. These findings reveal the complex nature of truthfulness in LLMs and underscore the importance of further research to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of LLMs and AI agents.

27. ***Operational Advice for Dense and Sparse Retrievers:  <br>Researchers provided practical guidance on selecting dense and sparse retrieval methods, recommending a hybrid approach for optimal performance. Their results guide practitioners in choosing between HNSW and flat indexes based on dataset size and use case.*** <br><br>
    Sep 10, Uni of Waterloo published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06464) “Operational Advice for Dense and Sparse Retrievers: HNSW, Flat, or Inverted Indexes?”. Practitioners working on dense retrieval today face a bewildering number of choices. Beyond selecting the embedding model, another consequential choice is the actual implementation of nearest-neighbor vector search. While best practices recommend HNSW indexes, flat vector indexes with brute-force search represent another viable option, particularly for smaller corpora and for rapid prototyping. This paper provides experimental results on the BEIR dataset using the open-source Lucene search library that explicate the tradeoffs between HNSW and flat indexes (including quantized variants) from the perspectives of indexing time, query evaluation performance, and retrieval quality. With additional comparisons between dense and sparse retrievers, the results provide guidance for today's search practitioner in understanding the design space of dense and sparse retrievers. Hybrid approached is recommended.

29. ***Agentic AI's Transformative Impact on Business and Technology:  <br>Forbes highlighted agentic AI, which can autonomously solve complex problems in various fields like healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity. Despite its potential, challenges such as ethical concerns and job displacement must be addressed as it evolves to augment human decision-making.*** <br><br>
    Sep 9, Forbes [published an article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2024/09/06/agentic-ai-the-next-big-breakthrough-thats-transforming-business-and-technology/) “Agentic AI: The Next Big Breakthrough That's Transforming Business And Technology”. Agentic AI is an advanced form of artificial intelligence that can autonomously act to achieve specific goals, offering more autonomy, proactivity, and problem-solving abilities than traditional AI systems. Unlike traditional AI, which responds to commands, agentic AI can break down complex tasks, learn from experiences, and adapt its strategies in dynamic environments.

1. ***OpenAI releases O1 models: <br>
OpenAI introduced O1, models that mimic human reasoning by thoroughly solving problems. The O1 models outperform previous iterations, excelling in fields like mathematics, physics, chemistry, and coding, and significantly improving on safety compliance. They are designed for complex workflows in professional settings such as healthcare and physics, with continuous updates planned to enhance their functionality.*** <br><br>
   Sep 12, OpenAI [released a new version O1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/). The o1-preview models are trained to think through problems thoroughly (yes, this means the models might take some time to respond to prompts), refining their approach and learning from mistakes, much like human reasoning. They outperform earlier models, scoring 83% on the International Mathematics Olympiad qualifying exam compared to GPT-4o's 13%, and excel in physics, chemistry, biology, and coding tasks. OpenAI has implemented a new safety training approach, leveraging the reasoning skills of these models to adhere more effectively to safety guidelines. The o1-preview scored 84 on difficult jailbreaking tests, a significant improvement over GPT-4o's score of 22, demonstrating enhanced compliance with safety rules. These models are ideal for professionals in fields requiring advanced reasoning, such as healthcare researchers, physicists, and developers who need to tackle complex workflows. For example, o1 can assist in annotating cell sequencing data, generating complex formulas in quantum physics, and executing multi-step coding tasks. OpenAI plans continuous updates to the o1 series, including adding features like browsing and file uploads. The goal is to develop models that reason like humans and solve increasingly complex problems across various domains.

3. ***DSBench: A new benchmark for data science agents: <br>
A new paper from the University of Texas at Dallas, Tencent, and the University of Southern California introduces DSBench, a benchmark aimed at evaluating data science agents using real-world tasks. The study highlights the limitations of current benchmarks and shows that existing large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) struggle with complex data tasks, achieving only a 34% success rate, signaling the need for more advanced data science agents.*** <br><br>
   Sep 12, Uni of Texas at Dallas, Tencent and Uni of Southern California published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07703) “DSBench: How Far Are Data Science Agents to Becoming Data Science Experts?”. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive language/vision reasoning abilities, igniting the recent trend of building agents for targeted applications such as shopping assistants or AI software engineers. Recently, many data science benchmarks have been proposed to investigate their performance in the data science domain. However, existing data science benchmarks still fall short when compared to real-world data science applications due to their simplified settings. To bridge this gap, the study introduces DSBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate data science agents with realistic tasks. This benchmark includes 466 data analysis tasks and 74 data modeling tasks, sourced from Eloquence and Kaggle competitions. DSBench offers a realistic setting by encompassing long contexts, multimodal task backgrounds, reasoning with large data files and multi-table structures, and performing end-to-end data modeling tasks. The evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, LVLMs, and agents shows that they struggle with most tasks, with the best agent solving only 34.12% of data analysis tasks and achieving a 34.74% Relative Performance Gap (RPG). These findings underscore the need for further advancements in developing more practical, intelligent, and autonomous data science agents.

5. ***Source2Synth: Synthetic data generation for LLMs: <br>
Meta, Oxford University, and University College London propose Source2Synth, a method for improving LLMs without human annotations by generating synthetic data. By focusing on structured reasoning and tool usage, Source2Synth significantly boosts LLM performance in multi-hop question answering and tabular data tasks by discarding low-quality outputs and grounding data generation in real-world sources.*** <br><br>
   Sep 12, Meta, Oxford Uni and Uni College London published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08239) “Source2Synth: Synthetic Data Generation and Curation Grounded in Real Data Sources”. Large Language Models still struggle in challenging scenarios that leverage structured data, complex reasoning, or tool usage. This paper proposes Source2Synth: a new method that can be used for teaching LLMs new skills without relying on costly human annotations. Source2Synth takes as input a custom data source and produces synthetic data points with intermediate reasoning steps grounded in real-world sources. Source2Synth improves the dataset quality by discarding low-quality generations based on their answerability. The study demonstrates the generality of this approach by applying it to two challenging domains: reasoning abilities in multi-hop question answering (MHQA), and tool usage in tabular question answering (TQA). The proposed method improves performance by 25.51% for TQA on WikiSQL and 22.57% for MHQA on HotPotQA compared to the fine-tuned baselines.

7. ***Laypeople’s reliance on LLM-generated legal advice: <br>
Research from the University of Nottingham and others reveals that while laypeople can distinguish between LLM- and lawyer-generated legal advice, they are more willing to follow the advice of LLMs. Despite participants favoring LLM advice, they accurately identified LLM texts at above chance-level, raising important questions about trust and the future role of LLMs in legal contexts.*** <br><br>
   Sep 12, Uni of Nottingham, Uni of Southampton and Uni of Antwerp published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07871) “Objection Overruled! Lay People can Distinguish Large Language Models from Lawyers, but still Favour Advice from an LLM”. Large Language Models (LLMs) are seemingly infiltrating every domain, and the legal context is no exception. This paper presents the results of three experiments (total N=288) that investigated lay people's willingness to act upon, and their ability to discriminate between, LLM- and lawyer-generated legal advice. In Experiment 1, participants judged their willingness to act on legal advice when the source of the advice was either known or unknown. When the advice source was unknown, participants indicated that they were significantly more willing to act on the LLM-generated advice. This result was replicated in Experiment 2. Intriguingly, despite participants indicating higher willingness to act on LLM-generated advice in Experiments 1 and 2, participants discriminated between the LLM- and lawyer-generated texts significantly above chance-level in Experiment 3. Lastly, the paper discusses potential explanations and risks of the findings, limitations and future work, and the importance of language complexity and real-world comparability.

9. ***PaperQA2: LLMs surpass human performance in scientific synthesis: <br>
FutureHouse Inc and collaborators demonstrate that PaperQA2, an advanced LLM for scientific literature, matches or exceeds human experts in summarizing and detecting contradictions in scientific papers. PaperQA2 outperforms Wikipedia summaries and helps identify contradictions in biology papers, showcasing LLMs’ growing role in scientific research and literature analysis.*** <br><br>
    Sep 12, FutureHouse Inc, Uni of Rochester, and Francis Circk Inst London published a [paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/fh-public/paperqa/Language_Agents_Science.pdf) “language agents achieve superhuman synthesis of scientific knowledge”. Language models are known to “hallucinate” incorrect information, and it is unclear if they are sufficiently accurate and reliable for use in scientific research. The authors developed a rigorous human-AI comparison methodology to evaluate language model agents on real-world literature search tasks covering information retrieval, summarization, and contradiction detection tasks. The study shows that PaperQA2, a frontier language model agent optimized for improved factuality, matches or exceeds subject matter expert performance on three realistic literature research tasks without any restrictions on humans (i.e., full access to internet, search tools, and time). PaperQA2 writes cited, Wikipedia-style summaries of scientific topics that are significantly more accurate than existing, human-written Wikipedia articles. The paper also introduces a hard benchmark for scientific literature research called LitQA2 that guided design of PaperQA2, leading to it exceeding human performance. Finally, the authors apply PaperQA2 to identify contradictions within the scientific literature, an important scientific task that is challenging for humans. PaperQA2 identifies 2.34 ± 1.99 (mean ± SD, N = 93 papers) contradictions per paper in a random subset of biology papers, of which 70% are validated by human experts. These results demonstrate that language model agents are now capable of exceeding domain experts across meaningful tasks on scientific literature.

11. ***LLMs reduce human participation in online knowledge platforms: <br>
A study from University College London, Cambridge, and others shows that the release of ChatGPT led to a 25% reduction in activity on Stack Overflow, especially in programming-related queries. The findings highlight the potential long-term impact of LLMs on reducing human-generated knowledge, which could limit future model training data availability.*** <br><br>
    Sep 11, Uni of College London, Uni of Cambridge et al. published a [paper](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/advance-article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae400/7754871)  on PNAS “Large language models reduce public knowledge sharing on online Q&A platforms". Large language models (LLMs) are a potential substitute for human-generated data and knowledge resources. This substitution, however, can present a significant problem for the training data needed to develop future models if it leads to a reduction of human-generated content. This paper documents a reduction in activity on Stack Overflow coinciding with the release of ChatGPT, a popular LLM. To test whether this reduction in activity is specific to the introduction of this LLM we use counterfactuals involving similar human-generated knowledge resources that should not be affected by the introduction of ChatGPT to such extent. Within six months of ChatGPT's release, activity on Stack Overflow decreased by 25% relative to its Russian and Chinese counterparts, where access to ChatGPT is limited, and to similar forums for mathematics, where ChatGPT is less capable. The authors interpret this estimate as a lower bound of the true impact of ChatGPT on Stack Overflow. The decline is larger for posts related to the most widely used programming languages. The study finds no significant change in post quality, measured by peer feedback, and observe similar decreases in content creation by more and less experienced users alike. Thus, LLMs are not only displacing duplicate, low-quality, or beginner-level content. The findings suggest that the rapid adoption of LLMs reduces the production of public data needed to train them, with significant consequences.

13. ***Agent Workflow Memory (AWM) improves task performance in LLMs: <br>
Researchers from CMU and MIT introduce Agent Workflow Memory (AWM), a system designed to help LLM-based agents reuse task workflows for better performance in web navigation tasks. AWM improves success rates in benchmarks like Mind2Web and WebArena, showing promise for enhancing agents' ability to perform complex, multi-step tasks.*** <br><br>
    Sep 11, CMU and MIT published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07429) “Agent Workflow Memory”. Despite the potential of language model-based agents to solve real-world tasks such as web navigation, current methods still struggle with long-horizon tasks with complex action trajectories. In contrast, humans can flexibly solve complex tasks by learning reusable task workflows from past experiences and using them to guide future actions. To build agents that can similarly benefit from this process, the study introduces Agent Workflow Memory (AWM), a method for inducing commonly reused routines, i.e., workflows, and selectively providing workflows to the agent to guide subsequent generations. AWM flexibly applies to both offline and online scenarios, where agents induce workflows from training examples beforehand or from test queries on the fly. The authors experiment on two major web navigation benchmarks -- Mind2Web and WebArena -- that collectively cover 1000+ tasks from 200+ domains across travel, shopping, and social media, among others. AWM substantially improves the baseline results by 24.6% and 51.1% relative success rate on Mind2Web and WebArena while reducing the number of steps taken to solve WebArena tasks successfully. Furthermore, online AWM robustly generalizes in cross-task, website, and domain evaluations, surpassing baselines from 8.9 to 14.0 absolute points as train-test task distribution gaps widen.

15. ***Synthetic continued pretraining for domain-specific LLMs: <br>
Stanford University researchers propose synthetic continued pretraining as a method to improve LLM performance on specialized domains using small corpora. By generating synthetic data and combining it with retrieval-augmented generation, this approach enhances models’ ability to learn domain-specific knowledge more efficiently.*** <br><br>
    Sep 11, Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07431) “Synthetic continued pretraining”. Pretraining on large-scale, unstructured internet text has enabled language models to acquire a significant amount of world knowledge. However, this knowledge acquisition is data-inefficient -- to learn a given fact, models must be trained on hundreds to thousands of diverse representations of it. This poses a challenge when adapting a pretrained model to a small corpus of domain-specific documents, where each fact may appear rarely or only once. The study proposes to bridge this gap with synthetic continued pretraining: using the small domain-specific corpus to synthesize a large corpus more amenable to learning, and then performing continued pretraining on the synthesized corpus. The paper instantiates this proposal with EntiGraph, a synthetic data augmentation algorithm that extracts salient entities from the source documents and then generates diverse text by drawing connections between the sampled entities. Synthetic continued pretraining using EntiGraph enables a language model to answer questions and follow generic instructions related to the source documents without access to them. If instead, the source documents are available at inference time, the authors show that the knowledge acquired through the approach compounds with retrieval-augmented generation. To better understand these results, the study builds a simple mathematical model of EntiGraph, and show how synthetic data augmentation can "rearrange" knowledge to enable more data-efficient learning.

17. ***Evaluating LLMs on research task reproduction with SUPER: <br>
A new benchmark, SUPER, from Allen Institute for AI and the University of Washington evaluates LLMs’ ability to set up and reproduce tasks from research repositories. Despite advancements, the best model could only solve 16.3% of end-to-end tasks, highlighting the challenges of fully autonomous research agents and the need for further progress in this area.*** <br><br>
    Sep 11, Allen Inst for AI and Uni of Washington published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07440) “SUPER: Evaluating Agents on Setting Up and Executing Tasks from Research Repositories”. Given that Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in writing code, can they now be used to autonomously reproduce results from research repositories? Such a capability would be a boon to the research community, helping researchers validate, understand, and extend prior work. To advance towards this goal, this work introduces SUPER, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capability of LLMs in setting up and executing tasks from research repositories. SUPER aims to capture the realistic challenges faced by researchers working with Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) research repositories. The benchmark comprises three distinct problem sets: 45 end-to-end problems with annotated expert solutions, 152 sub problems derived from the expert set that focus on specific challenges (e.g., configuring a trainer), and 602 automatically generated problems for larger-scale development. The paper introduces various evaluation measures to assess both task success and progress, utilizing gold solutions when available or approximations otherwise. The work shows that state-of-the-art approaches struggle to solve these problems with the best model (GPT-4o) solving only 16.3% of the end-to-end set, and 46.1% of the scenarios. This illustrates the challenge of this task, and suggests that SUPER can serve as a valuable resource for the community to make and measure progress.

19. ***LLMs generate novel scientific research ideas: <br>
A study by IITP and Oak Ridge National Laboratory explores how LLMs can generate novel research ideas across various domains. Claude-2 and GPT-4 were found to align more with human authors' perspectives, while Claude-2 generated more diverse ideas. Human evaluations of these ideas showed that LLMs are evolving in their capability to assist in idea generation.*** <br><br>
    Sep 10, IITP and Oak Ridge National Laborator published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06185) “Can Large Language Models Unlock Novel Scientific Research Ideas?”. "An idea is nothing more nor less than a new combination of old elements" (Young, J.W.). The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and publicly available ChatGPT have marked a significant turning point in the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into people's everyday lives. This study explores the capability of LLMs in generating novel research ideas based on information from research papers. The study conducts a thorough examination of 4 LLMs in five domains (e.g., Chemistry, Computer, Economics, Medical, and Physics). The paper found that the future research ideas generated by Claude-2 and GPT-4 are more aligned with the author's perspective than GPT-3.5 and Gemini. It is also found that Claude-2 generates more diverse future research ideas than GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Gemini 1.0. The study further performed a human evaluation of the novelty, relevancy, and feasibility of the generated future research ideas. This investigation offers insights into the evolving role of LLMs in idea generation, highlighting both its capability and limitations. The work contributes to the ongoing efforts in evaluating and utilizing language models for generating future research ideas. The datasets and codes publicly available.

21. ***Structural Hallucinations in LLMs: <br>
A paper from DataLabs argues that hallucinations in LLMs are inevitable due to their mathematical structure and cannot be eliminated. The work frames these hallucinations as a structural feature of LLMs, challenging the notion that improving data or algorithms can fully mitigate this issue.*** <br><br>
    Sep 9, DataLabs United We Care published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05746) “LLMs Will Always Hallucinate, and We Need to Live With This”. As Large Language Models become more ubiquitous across domains, it becomes important to examine their inherent limitations critically. This work argues that hallucinations in language models are not just occasional errors but an inevitable feature of these systems. The study demonstrates that hallucinations stem from the fundamental mathematical and logical structure of LLMs. It is, therefore, impossible to eliminate them through architectural improvements, dataset enhancements, or fact-checking mechanisms. The analysis draws on computational theory and Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem, which references the undecidability of problems like the Halting, Emptiness, and Acceptance Problems. The paper demonstrates that every stage of the LLM process-from training data compilation to fact retrieval, intent classification, and text generation-will have a non-zero probability of producing hallucinations. This work introduces the concept of Structural Hallucination as an intrinsic nature of these systems. By establishing the mathematical certainty of hallucinations, the study challenge the prevailing notion that they can be fully mitigated.

23. ***LLMs' novelty in generating research ideas vs. human experts: <br>
A large-scale study with 100+ NLP researchers compared LLMs with human experts in generating research ideas. The findings suggest that LLMs generate more novel ideas but slightly lag in feasibility. The study identifies gaps in LLM self-evaluation and proposes future evaluations to focus on complete research projects.*** <br><br>
    Sep 6, CMU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04109) “Can LLMs Generate Novel Research Ideas? A Large-Scale Human Study with 100+ NLP Researchers”. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have sparked optimism about their potential to accelerate scientific discovery, with a growing number of works proposing research agents that autonomously generate and validate new ideas. Despite this, no evaluations have shown that LLM systems can take the very first step of producing novel, expert-level ideas, let alone perform the entire research process. The study addresses this by establishing an experimental design that evaluates research idea generation while controlling for confounders and performs the first head-to-head comparison between expert NLP researchers and an LLM ideation agent. By recruiting over 100 NLP researchers to write novel ideas and blind reviews of both LLM and human ideas, the study obtains the first statistically significant conclusion on current LLM capabilities for research ideation: the authors find LLM-generated ideas are judged as more novel (p < 0.05) than human expert ideas while being judged slightly weaker on feasibility. Studying the agent baselines closely, the authors identify open problems in building and evaluating research agents, including failures of LLM self-evaluation and their lack of diversity in generation. Finally, the authors acknowledge that human judgements of novelty can be difficult, even by experts, and propose an end-to-end study design which recruits researchers to execute these ideas into full projects, enabling the authors to study whether these novelty and feasibility judgements result in meaningful differences in research outcome.

25. ***Paper Copilot for personalized academic assistance: <br>
Researchers from UIUC, CMU, and Carleton College developed Paper Copilot, an LLM-based tool designed to assist researchers by providing personalized, real-time literature updates and thought retrieval. Paper Copilot demonstrated efficiency in streamlining the research process, saving nearly 70% of time in evaluations.*** <br><br>
    Sep 6, UIUC, CMU and Carleton College published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04593) “Paper Copilot: A Self-Evolving and Efficient LLM System for Personalized Academic Assistance”. As scientific research proliferates, researchers face the daunting task of navigating and reading vast amounts of literature. Existing solutions, such as document QA, fail to provide personalized and up-to-date information efficiently. The authors present Paper Copilot, a self-evolving, efficient LLM system designed to assist researchers, based on thought-retrieval, user profile and high performance optimization. Specifically, Paper Copilot can offer personalized research services, maintaining a real-time updated database. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that Paper Copilot saves 69.92\% of time after efficient deployment. This paper details the design and implementation of Paper Copilot, highlighting its contributions to personalized academic support and its potential to streamline the research process.

27. ***GPTs struggle with controversial and limited-data topics: <br>
A Harvard University paper discusses why GPTs struggle with topics that lack a general consensus or are controversial. The study emphasizes that LLMs perform well with popular topics but exhibit variability in outputs when trained on obscure or polarized topics, linking accuracy to the quality and breadth of training data.*** <br><br>
    Sep 5, ACM Queue published a [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3688007) from Harvard Uni “GPTs and Hallucination: Why do large language models hallucinate?” The findings in this experiment support the hypothesis that GPTs based on LLMs perform well on prompts that are more popular and have reached a general consensus yet struggle on controversial topics or topics with limited data. The variability in the applications's responses underscores that the models depend on the quantity and quality of their training data, paralleling the system of crowdsourcing that relies on diverse and credible contributions. Thus, while GPTs can serve as useful tools for many mundane tasks, their engagement with obscure and polarized topics should be interpreted with caution. LLMs' reliance on probabilistic models to produce statements about the world ties their accuracy closely to the breadth and quality of the data they're given.

29. ***Safe Superintelligence startup raises $1 billion: <br>
OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever’s new AI safety-focused startup, Safe Superintelligence (SSI), raised $1 billion. SSI aims to develop superintelligent systems with a focus on safety to prevent AI-related risks. This signals increasing industry attention on AI safety amid rapid advancements in AI technology.*** <br><br>
    Sep 5, [according to Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-co-founder-sutskevers-new-safety-focused-ai-startup-ssi-raises-1-billion-2024-09-04/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email), OpenAI co-founder Sutskever's new safety-focused AI startup SSI raises $1 billion. Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI's former chief scientist, has launched a new venture with a bang. His startup, Safe Superintelligence (SSI), raised $1 billion from top-tier investors to tackle one of AI's biggest challenges: building superintelligent systems that won't accidentally erase humanity. With a $5 billion valuation and only 10 employees (for now), SSI focuses on R&D for a few years before even thinking about a product. They're hiring for "good character" over credentials and taking a fresh approach to AI scaling. Sutskever's move comes after his dramatic exit from OpenAI. This massive investment signals that AI safety concerns are becoming more prevalent. Plus, his focus exclusively on safety can influence how the entire industry approaches superintelligent AI development.

31. ***Modular LLMs for greater efficiency and scalability: <br>
A paper co-authored by multiple institutions introduces Configurable Foundation Models, which break LLMs into modular components, or "bricks," to enhance computational efficiency and scalability. The modular approach enables flexible and dynamic configurations, allowing for more efficient and scalable AI models.*** <br><br>
    Sep 4, Tsinghua Uni, Uni of California San Diego, CMU, ModelBest Inc, Princeton Uni, Nat Uni Singapore, Stanford Uni, and Uni of California Los Angeles published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02877) “Configurable Foundation Models: Building LLMs from a Modular Perspective”. Advancements in LLMs have recently unveiled challenges tied to computational efficiency and continual scalability due to their requirements of huge parameters, making the applications and evolution of these models on devices with limited computation resources and scenarios requiring various abilities increasingly cumbersome. Inspired by modularity within the human brain, there is a growing tendency to decompose LLMs into numerous functional modules, allowing for inference with part of modules and dynamic assembly of modules to tackle complex tasks, such as mixture-of-experts. To highlight the inherent efficiency and composability of the modular approach, The researchers coin the term brick to represent each functional module, designating the modularized structure as configurable foundation models. The paper offers a comprehensive overview and investigation of the construction, utilization, and limitation of configurable foundation models. It first formalizes modules into emergent bricks - functional neuron partitions that emerge during the pre-training phase, and customized bricks - bricks constructed via additional post-training to improve the capabilities and knowledge of LLMs. Based on diverse functional bricks, the paper further presents four brick-oriented operations: retrieval and routing, merging, updating, and growing. These operations allow for dynamic configuration of LLMs based on instructions to handle complex tasks. To verify the perspective, the authors conduct an empirical analysis on widely-used LLMs, and find that the FFN layers follow modular patterns with functional specialization of neurons and functional neuron partitions. Finally, the study highlights several open issues and directions for future research. Overall, this paper aims to offer a fresh modular perspective on existing LLM research and inspire the future creation of more efficient and scalable foundational models.

1. ***Key Findings on Few-Shot Learning and Fine-Tuning in LLMs: <br>A study published by Area Science Park Trieste compares In-context Learning (ICL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in large language models (LLMs). While both strategies improve performance on specific tasks, the internal representations they induce are markedly different. ICL creates hierarchical, semantically organized representations, while SFT's are fuzzier and more mixed. Despite this, SFT develops probability modes better suited for encoding answers. This highlights the diverse computational strategies of LLMs.*** <br><br>
   Sep 7, Area Science Park Trieste published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03662) “The representation landscape of few-shot learning and fine-tuning in large language models”. In-context learning (ICL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) are two common strategies for improving the performance of modern large language models (LLMs) on specific tasks. Despite their different natures, these strategies often lead to comparable performance gains. However, little is known about whether they induce similar representations inside LLMs. The authors approach this problem by analyzing the probability landscape of their hidden representations in the two cases. More specifically, the study compares how LLMs solve the same question-answering task, finding that ICL and SFT create very different internal structures, in both cases undergoing a sharp transition in the middle of the network. In the first half of the network, ICL shapes interpretable representations hierarchically organized according to their semantic content. In contrast, the probability landscape obtained with SFT is fuzzier and semantically mixed. In the second half of the model, the fine-tuned representations develop probability modes that better encode the identity of answers, while the landscape of ICL representations is characterized by less defined peaks. The approach reveals the diverse computational strategies developed inside LLMs to solve the same task across different conditions, allowing researchers to make a step towards designing optimal methods to extract information from language models.

3. ***Salesforce Introduces xLAM for AI Agent Systems: <br>Salesforce's paper presents the xLAM family of large action models, designed to enhance AI agent tasks. These models, ranging from 1B to 8x22B parameters, are trained using a scalable pipeline unifying various datasets. xLAM models outperform GPT-4 and Claude-3 in tool use, placing first on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard. By releasing xLAM, Salesforce aims to democratize access to high-performance models for autonomous agents.*** <br><br>
   Sep 5, Salesforce published a paper “xLAM: A Family of Large Action Models to Empower AI Agent Systems”. Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant research interest. However, the open-source community faces many challenges in developing specialized models for agent tasks, driven by the scarcity of high-quality agent datasets and the absence of standard protocols in this area. The study introduces and publicly releases xLAM, a series of large action models designed for AI agent tasks. The xLAM series includes five models with both dense and mixture-of-expert architectures, ranging from 1B to 8x22B parameters, trained using a scalable, flexible pipeline that unifies, augments, and synthesizes diverse datasets to enhance AI agents' generalizability and performance across varied environments. Experimental results demonstrate that xLAM consistently delivers exceptional performance across multiple agent ability benchmarks, notably securing the 1st position on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard, outperforming GPT-4, Claude-3, and many other models in terms of tool use. By releasing the xLAM series, the authors aim to advance the performance of open-source LLMs for autonomous AI agents, potentially accelerating progress and democratizing access to high-performance models for agent tasks.

5. ***Google’s Framework for Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning in LLMs: <br>Google’s paper introduces a multi-turn direct preference learning framework to improve LLMs' mathematical reasoning. Tailored for tasks integrating external tools like code interpreters, this method boosts performance, particularly in models fine-tuned for multi-turn reasoning. Experimentation shows marked improvements in benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH, demonstrating the framework’s effectiveness in optimizing model trajectories.*** <br><br>
   Sep 4, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03215) “Building Math Agents with Multi-Turn Iterative Preference Learning”. Recent studies have shown that large language models' (LLMs) mathematical problem-solving capabilities can be enhanced by integrating external tools, such as code interpreters, and employing multi-turn Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. While current methods focus on synthetic data generation and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), this paper studies the complementary direct preference learning approach to further improve model performance. However, existing direct preference learning algorithms are originally designed for the single-turn chat task, and do not fully address the complexities of multi-turn reasoning and external tool integration required for tool-integrated mathematical reasoning tasks. To fill in this gap, the paper introduces a multi-turn direct preference learning framework, tailored for this context, that leverages feedback from code interpreters and optimizes trajectory-level preferences. This framework includes multi-turn DPO and multi-turn KTO as specific implementations. The effectiveness of the framework is validated through training of various language models using an augmented prompt set from the GSM8K and MATH datasets. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements: a supervised fine-tuned Gemma-1.1-it-7B model's performance increased from 77.5% to 83.9% on GSM8K and from 46.1% to 51.2% on MATH. Similarly, a Gemma-2-it-9B model improved from 84.1% to 86.3% on GSM8K and from 51.0% to 54.5% on MATH.

7. ***Simula Research Lab Examines LLMs in Log Parsing: <br>A study published by Simula Research Lab evaluates six LLMs, including GPT-3.5 and CodeLlama, in log parsing tasks. The results show that free-to-use models can compete with proprietary models, with CodeLlama outperforming GPT-3.5 by 10% in correct template extraction. These findings highlight the potential of open-source models in log parsing and their usability advantages.*** <br><br>
   Sep 4, Simula Research Lab published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02474) “A Comparative Study on Large Language Models for Log Parsing”. Log messages provide valuable information about the status of software systems. This information is provided in an unstructured fashion and automated approaches are applied to extract relevant parameters. To ease this process, log parsing can be applied, which transforms log messages into structured log templates. Recent advances in language models have led to several studies that apply ChatGPT to the task of log parsing with promising results. However, the performance of other state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the log parsing task remains unclear. This study investigates the current capability of state-of-the-art LLMs to perform log parsing. The authors select six recent LLMs, including both paid proprietary (GPT-3.5, Claude 2.1) and four free-to-use open models, and compare their performance on system logs obtained from a selection of mature open-source projects. The study designs two different prompting approaches and apply the LLMs on 1, 354 log templates across 16 different projects. The study evaluates their effectiveness, in the number of correctly identified templates, and the syntactic similarity between the generated templates and the ground truth. The paper found that free-to-use models are able to compete with paid models, with CodeLlama extracting 10% more log templates correctly than GPT-3.5. Moreover, the authors provide qualitative insights into the usability of language models (e.g., how easy it is to use their responses). The results reveal that some of the smaller, free-to-use LLMs can considerably assist log parsing compared to their paid proprietary competitors, especially code-specialized models.

9. ***OLMoE: A High-Performance Open Mixture-of-Experts Model: <br>A collaborative paper introduces OLMoE, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model with 7 billion parameters. Trained on 5 trillion tokens, OLMoE outperforms larger models like Llama2-13B-Chat, proving the efficacy of sparse MoE architectures. The authors open-source all components, aiming to advance the capabilities of open models.*** <br><br>
    Sep 3, Allen Inst for AI, Contextual AI, Uni of Washington and Princeton Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02060) “OLMoE: Open Mixture-of-Experts Language Models”. The paper introduces OLMoE, a fully open, state-of-the-art language model leveraging sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). OLMoE-1B-7B has 7 billion (B) parameters but uses only 1B per input token. The paper pretrains it on 5 trillion tokens and further adapt it to create OLMoE-1B-7B-Instruct. The models outperform all available models with similar active parameters, even surpassing larger ones like Llama2-13B-Chat and DeepSeekMoE-16B. The paper presents various experiments on MoE training, analyze routing in the model showing high specialization, and open-source all aspects of the work: model weights, training data, [code](https://github.com/allenai/OLMoE), and logs.

11. ***GOT Model Aims to Revolutionize OCR: <br>researchers introduced the General OCR Theory (GOT) and its model, OCR-2.0. GOT handles a broad spectrum of artificial optical characters, offering region-specific recognition and interactive features. Experiments demonstrate its superiority over traditional OCR systems, positioning it as a comprehensive solution for modern OCR needs.*** <br><br>
    Sep 3, StepFun, Megvii Tech, UCAS, and Tsinghua Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01704) “General OCR Theory: Towards OCR-2.0 via a Unified End-to-end Model”. Traditional OCR systems (OCR-1.0) are increasingly unable to meet people's usage due to the growing demand for intelligent processing of man-made optical characters. This paper collectively refers to all artificial optical signals (e.g., plain texts, math/molecular formulas, tables, charts, sheet music, and even geometric shapes) as "characters" and propose the General OCR Theory along with an excellent model, namely GOT, to promote the arrival of OCR-2.0. The GOT, with 580M parameters, is a unified, elegant, and end-to-end model, consisting of a high-compression encoder and a long-contexts decoder. As an OCR-2.0 model, GOT can handle all the above "characters" under various OCR tasks. On the input side, the model supports commonly used scene- and document-style images in slice and whole-page styles. On the output side, GOT can generate plain or formatted results (markdown/tikz/smiles/kern) via an easy prompt. Besides, the model enjoys interactive OCR features, i.e., region-level recognition guided by coordinates or colors. Furthermore, the authors also adapt dynamic resolution and multi-page OCR technologies to GOT for better practicality. In experiments, the paper provides sufficient results to prove the superiority of the model.

13. ***Political DEBATE: Efficient Classifiers for Political Texts: <br>Princeton University and collaborators published a paper introducing Political DEBATE models for zero-shot and few-shot classification of political texts. These models outperform state-of-the-art classifiers, offering efficient, open-source solutions. Additionally, the release of the PolNLI dataset facilitates further research in political document classification.*** <br><br>
    Sep 2, Princeton Uni, Pennsylvania State Uni and Louisiana State Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02078) “Political DEBATE: Efficient Zero-shot and Few-shot Classifiers for Political Text”. Social scientists quickly adopted large language models due to their ability to annotate documents without supervised training, an ability known as zero-shot learning. However, due to their compute demands, cost, and often proprietary nature, these models are often at odds with replication and open science standards. This paper introduces the Political DEBATE (DeBERTa Algorithm for Textual Entailment) language models for zero-shot and few-shot classification of political documents. These models are not only as good, or better than, state-of-the art large language models at zero and few-shot classification, but are orders of magnitude more efficient and completely open source. By training the models on a simple random sample of 10-25 documents, they can outperform supervised classifiers trained on hundreds or thousands of documents and state-of-the-art generative models with complex, engineered prompts. Additionally, the authors release the PolNLI dataset used to train these models -- a corpus of over 200,000 political documents with highly accurate labels across over 800 classification tasks.

15. ***Using Report Cards to Qualitatively Evaluate LLMs: <br>The University of Toronto and the Vector Institute published a paper introducing "Report Cards"—natural language summaries of LLM behavior. These qualitative evaluations provide clearer insights into model performance than traditional benchmarks, enabling more interpretable and holistic assessments of LLMs.*** <br><br>
    Sep 1, Uni of Toronto and Vector Inst published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00844) “Report Cards: Qualitative Evaluation of Language Models Using Natural Language Summaries”. The rapid development and dynamic nature of large language models (LLMs) make it difficult for conventional quantitative benchmarks to accurately assess their capabilities. The paper proposes report cards, which are human-interpretable, natural language summaries of model behavior for specific skills or topics. The authors develop a framework to evaluate report cards based on three criteria: specificity (ability to distinguish between models), faithfulness (accurate representation of model capabilities), and interpretability (clarity and relevance to humans). The paper also proposes an iterative algorithm for generating report cards without human supervision and explore its efficacy by ablating various design choices. Through experimentation with popular LLMs, the authors demonstrate that report cards provide insights beyond traditional benchmarks and can help address the need for a more interpretable and holistic evaluation of LLMs.

17. ***MIT Investigates Dataset Licensing in AI: <br>MIT's study systematically audits over 1,800 datasets to address legal and ethical concerns related to dataset licensing and attribution in AI. The findings reveal widespread misattribution, underscoring the need for better transparency in dataset usage. To facilitate this, the study releases an interactive tool, the Data Provenance Explorer, for tracing dataset lineage.*** <br><br>
    Aug 30, MIT published a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00878-8) on Nature Machine Intelligence “A large-scale audit of dataset licensing and attribution in AI”. The race to train language models on vast, diverse and inconsistently documented datasets raises pressing legal and ethical concerns. To improve data transparency and understanding, the study convenes a multi-disciplinary effort between legal and machine learning experts to systematically audit and trace more than 1,800 text datasets. The authors develop tools and standards to trace the lineage of these datasets, including their source, creators, licences and subsequent use. The landscape analysis highlights sharp divides in the composition and focus of data licenced for commercial use. Important categories including low-resource languages, creative tasks and new synthetic data all tend to be restrictively licenced. The authors observe frequent miscategorization of licences on popular dataset hosting sites, with licence omission rates of more than 70% and error rates of more than 50%. This highlights a crisis in misattribution and informed use of popular datasets driving many recent breakthroughs. The analysis of data sources also explains the application of copyright law and fair use to finetuning data. As a contribution to continuing improvements in dataset transparency and responsible use, the authors release the audit, with an interactive user interface, the Data Provenance Explorer, to enable practitioners to trace and filter on data provenance for the most popular finetuning data collections: www.dataprovenance.org.

19. ***Reassessing AI Alignment Beyond Preferences: <br>A collaborative paper published challenges the preferentist approach to AI alignment, arguing that aligning AI with human values requires going beyond preferences. The authors propose aligning AI with normative standards suited to their social roles, advocating for stakeholder negotiation to ensure alignment promotes mutual benefit across diverse values.*** <br><br>
    Aug 30, MIT, UC Berkeley, Uni of College London, and Uni of Cambridge published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16984) “Beyond Preferences in AI Alignment”. The dominant practice of AI alignment assumes (1) that preferences are an adequate representation of human values, (2) that human rationality can be understood in terms of maximizing the satisfaction of preferences, and (3) that AI systems should be aligned with the preferences of one or more humans to ensure that they behave safely and in accordance with our values. Whether implicitly followed or explicitly endorsed, these commitments constitute what we term a preferentist approach to AI alignment. This paper characterizes and challenges the preferentist approach, describing conceptual and technical alternatives that are ripe for further research. The authors first survey the limits of rational choice theory as a descriptive model, explaining how preferences fail to capture the thick semantic content of human values, and how utility representations neglect the possible incommensurability of those values. The authors then critique the normativity of expected utility theory (EUT) for humans and AI, drawing upon arguments showing how rational agents need not comply with EUT, while highlighting how EUT is silent on which preferences are normatively acceptable. Finally, the researchers argue that these limitations motivate a reframing of the targets of AI alignment: Instead of alignment with the preferences of a human user, developer, or humanity-writ-large, AI systems should be aligned with normative standards appropriate to their social roles, such as the role of a general-purpose assistant. Furthermore, these standards should be negotiated and agreed upon by all relevant stakeholders. On this alternative conception of alignment, a multiplicity of AI systems will be able to serve diverse ends, aligned with normative standards that promote mutual benefit and limit harm despite our plural and divergent values.

21. ***Arctic-SnowCoder: Improving Code Pretraining with High-Quality Data: <br>Researchers from Snowflake and universities introduced Arctic-SnowCoder, a data-efficient model that achieves state-of-the-art performance in code pretraining. Through progressively refined data phases, the model demonstrates the importance of high-quality data aligned with downstream applications, outperforming larger models despite being trained on fewer tokens.*** <br><br>
    Aug 30, Snowflake, UIUC and Seul Nat Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02326) “Arctic-SnowCoder: Demystifying High-Quality Data in Code Pretraining”. Recent studies have been increasingly demonstrating that high-quality data is crucial for effective pretraining of language models. However, the precise definition of "high-quality" remains underexplored. Focusing on the code domain, the paper introduces Arctic-SnowCoder-1.3B, a data-efficient base code model pretrained on 555B tokens through three phases of progressively refined data: (1) general pretraining with 500B standard-quality code tokens, preprocessed through basic filtering, deduplication, and decontamination, (2) continued pretraining with 50B high-quality tokens, selected from phase one by a BERT-style quality annotator trained to distinguish good code from random data, using positive examples drawn from high-quality code files, along with instruction data from Magicoder and StarCoder2-Instruct, and (3) enhanced pretraining with 5B synthetic data created by Llama-3.1-70B using phase two data as seeds, adapting the Magicoder approach for pretraining. Despite being trained on a limited dataset, Arctic-SnowCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance on BigCodeBench, a coding benchmark focusing on practical and challenging programming tasks, compared to similarly sized models trained on no more than 1T tokens, outperforming Phi-1.5-1.3B by 36%. Across all evaluated benchmarks, Arctic-SnowCoder-1.3B beats StarCoderBase-3B pretrained on 1T tokens. Additionally, it matches the performance of leading small base code models trained on trillions of tokens. For example, Arctic-SnowCoder-1.3B surpasses StarCoder2-3B, pretrained on over 3.3T tokens, on HumanEval+, a benchmark that evaluates function-level code generation, and remains competitive on BigCodeBench. The evaluation presents a comprehensive analysis justifying various design choices for Arctic-SnowCoder. Most importantly, the authors find that the key to high-quality data is its alignment with the distribution of downstream applications.

23. ***Jina-ColBERT-v2: Advancing Multilingual Retrieval: <br>A paper presents Jina-ColBERT-v2, an optimized version of the ColBERT model for multilingual retrieval tasks. By improving efficiency and cutting storage requirements, the model demonstrates strong performance across multiple retrieval benchmarks while maintaining its effectiveness in a bi-encoder architecture.*** <br><br>
    Aug 30, Uni of Texas at Austin and Jina AI GmbH published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16672) “Jina-ColBERT-v2: A General-Purpose Multilingual Late Interaction Retriever”. Multi-vector dense models, such as ColBERT, have proven highly effective in information retrieval. ColBERT's late interaction scoring approximates the joint query-document attention seen in cross-encoders while maintaining inference efficiency closer to traditional dense retrieval models, thanks to its bi-encoder architecture and recent optimizations in indexing and search. This paper introduces several improvements to the ColBERT model architecture and training pipeline, leveraging techniques successful in the more established single-vector embedding model paradigm, particularly those suited for heterogeneous multilingual data. The new model, Jina-ColBERT-v2, demonstrates strong performance across a range of English and multilingual retrieval tasks, while also cutting storage requirements by up to 50% compared to previous models.

25. ***Improving OCR with Context Leveraging Models: <br>University College London's paper introduces CLOCR-C, a model that leverages context-adaptive abilities of transformer-based language models to correct OCR errors in digitized historical archives. By incorporating socio-cultural context, CLOCR-C significantly reduces error rates and improves the quality of OCR for downstream tasks like Named Entity Recognition.*** <br><br>
    Aug 30, Uni of College London published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17428) “CLOCR-C: Context Leveraging OCR Correction with Pre-trained Language Models”. The digitisation of historical print media archives is crucial for increasing accessibility to contemporary records. However, the process of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) used to convert physical records to digital text is prone to errors, particularly in the case of newspapers and periodicals due to their complex layouts. This paper introduces Context Leveraging OCR Correction (CLOCR-C), which utilises the infilling and context-adaptive abilities of transformer-based language models (LMs) to improve OCR quality. The study aims to determine if LMs can perform post-OCR correction, improve downstream NLP tasks, and the value of providing the socio-cultural context as part of the correction process. Experiments were conducted using seven LMs on three datasets: the 19th Century Serials Edition (NCSE) and two datasets from the Overproof collection. The results demonstrate that some LMs can significantly reduce error rates, with the top-performing model achieving over a 60% reduction in character error rate on the NCSE dataset. The OCR improvements extend to downstream tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition, with increased Cosine Named Entity Similarity. Furthermore, the study shows that providing socio-cultural context in the prompts improves performance, while misleading prompts lower performance. In addition to the findings, this study releases a dataset of 91 transcribed articles from the NCSE, containing a total of 40 thousand words, to support further research in this area. The findings suggest that CLOCR-C is a promising approach for enhancing the quality of existing digital archives by leveraging the socio-cultural information embedded in the LMs and the text requiring correction.

27. ***PrivacyLens: Evaluating Privacy Norm Awareness in LLMs: <br>a paper proposes PrivacyLens, a framework to evaluate LLMs’ awareness of privacy norms in communication scenarios. Results show that even state-of-the-art LLMs, like GPT-4 and Llama-3, often leak sensitive information despite privacy-enhancing prompts. PrivacyLens provides a structured evaluation tool to measure and mitigate privacy risks in LLMs.*** <br><br>
    Aug 29, Stanford Uni, Northeastern Uni and Harvard Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00138) “PrivacyLens: Evaluating Privacy Norm Awareness of Language Models in Action”. As language models (LMs) are widely utilized in personalized communication scenarios (e.g., sending emails, writing social media posts) and endowed with a certain level of agency, ensuring they act in accordance with the contextual privacy norms becomes increasingly critical. However, quantifying the privacy norm awareness of LMs and the emerging privacy risk in LM-mediated communication is challenging due to (1) the contextual and long-tailed nature of privacy-sensitive cases, and (2) the lack of evaluation approaches that capture realistic application scenarios. To address these challenges, the authors propose PrivacyLens, a novel framework designed to extend privacy-sensitive seeds into expressive vignettes and further into agent trajectories, enabling multi-level evaluation of privacy leakage in LM agents' actions. The authors instantiate PrivacyLens with a collection of privacy norms grounded in privacy literature and crowdsourced seeds. Using this dataset, the paper reveals a discrepancy between LM performance in answering probing questions and their actual behavior when executing user instructions in an agent setup. State-of-the-art LMs, like GPT-4 and Llama-3-70B, leak sensitive information in 25.68% and 38.69% of cases, even when prompted with privacy-enhancing instructions. The authors also demonstrate the dynamic nature of PrivacyLens by extending each seed into multiple trajectories to red-team LM privacy leakage risk.

33. ***Generative Verifiers in Reward Modeling and Next-Token Prediction: <br>Google’s paper, "Generative Verifiers: Reward Modeling as Next-Token Prediction," discusses improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) using verifiers trained through next-token prediction. This method, referred to as generative verifiers (GenRM), combines verification with solution generation. GenRM enhances chain-of-thought reasoning and integrates seamlessly with instruction tuning, outperforming standard discriminative verifiers and LLM-as-a-Judge by 16-64% on various reasoning tasks.*** <br><br>
    Aug 28, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15240) “Generative Verifiers: Reward Modeling as Next-Token Prediction”. Verifiers or reward models are often used to enhance the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). A common approach is the Best-of-N method, where N candidate solutions generated by the LLM are ranked by a verifier, and the best one is selected. While LLM-based verifiers are typically trained as discriminative classifiers to score solutions, they do not utilize the text generation capabilities of pretrained LLMs. To overcome this limitation, the study instead proposes training verifiers using the ubiquitous next-token prediction objective, jointly on verification and solution generation. Compared to standard verifiers, such generative verifiers (GenRM) can benefit from several advantages of LLMs: they integrate seamlessly with instruction tuning, enable chain-of-thought reasoning, and can utilize additional inference-time compute via majority voting for better verification. The authors demonstrate that when using Gemma-based verifiers on algorithmic and grade-school math reasoning tasks, GenRM outperforms discriminative verifiers and LLM-as-a-Judge, showing a 16-64% improvement in the percentage of problems solved with Best-of-N. Furthermore, the study shows that GenRM scales favorably across dataset size, model capacity, and inference-time compute.

35. ***Engaged Human Learning Through Language Model Agent Conversations: <br>Stanford and Yale Universities introduced "Into the Unknown Unknowns: Engaged Human Learning through Participation in Language Model Agent Conversations." The study proposes Co-STORM, an LM-powered system where users observe and interact with conversations between multiple LM agents to discover unknown unknowns. Co-STORM organizes information into dynamic mind maps and outperforms traditional search engines and RAG chatbots in human evaluation.*** <br><br>
    Aug 27, Stanford Uni and Yale Uni published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15232) “Into the Unknown Unknowns: Engaged Human Learning through Participation in Language Model Agent Conversations”. While language model (LM)-powered chatbots and generative search engines excel at answering concrete queries, discovering information in the terrain of unknown unknowns remains challenging for users. To emulate the common educational scenario where children/students learn by listening to and participating in conversations of their parents/teachers, the study creates Collaborative STORM (Co-STORM). Unlike QA systems that require users to ask all the questions, Co-STORM lets users observe and occasionally steer the discourse among several LM agents. The agents ask questions on the user's behalf, allowing the user to discover unknown unknowns serendipitously. To facilitate user interaction, Co-STORM assists users in tracking the discourse by organizing the uncovered information into a dynamic mind map, ultimately generating a comprehensive report as takeaways. For automatic evaluation, the authors construct the WildSeek dataset by collecting real information-seeking records with user goals. Co-STORM outperforms baseline methods on both discourse trace and report quality. In a further human evaluation, 70% of participants prefer Co-STORM over a search engine, and 78% favor it over a RAG chatbot.

37. ***Loss of Plasticity in Deep Continual Learning: <br>The University of Alberta’s paper published in Nature explores the limitations of deep learning in continual learning settings. It shows that deep learning models gradually lose plasticity, learning no better than shallow networks. The study highlights that only algorithms injecting random variability, such as continual backpropagation, can maintain plasticity indefinitely, suggesting that gradient-descent-based methods alone are insufficient for sustained deep learning.*** <br><br>
    Aug 21, Uni of Alberta published a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07711-7) on Nature “Loss of plasticity in deep continual learning”. Artificial neural networks, deep-learning methods and the backpropagation algorithm form the foundation of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. These methods are almost always used in two phases, one in which the weights of the network are updated and one in which the weights are held constant while the network is used or evaluated. This contrasts with natural learning and many applications, which require continual learning. It has been unclear whether or not deep learning methods work in continual learning settings. Here the authors show that they do not—that standard deep-learning methods gradually lose plasticity in continual-learning settings until they learn no better than a shallow network. The study shows such loss of plasticity using the classic ImageNet dataset and reinforcement-learning problems across a wide range of variations in the network and the learning algorithm. Plasticity is maintained indefinitely only by algorithms that continually inject diversity into the network, such as the proposed continual backpropagation algorithm, a variation of backpropagation in which a small fraction of less-used units are continually and randomly reinitialized. The results indicate that methods based on gradient descent are not enough—that sustained deep learning requires a random, non-gradient component to maintain variability and plasticity.

The authors find a strong correlation between cross-modal alignment, vision representation, and model performance. They develop the AC score, which quantifies these factors and shows a linear relationship with model performance. By identifying optimal vision representations without needing to fine-tune the language model, they reduce computational costs by 99.7%.*** <br><br>
   Aug 29, Stanford Uni and UC Berkeley published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16357) “Law of Vision Representation in MLLMs”. The paper presents the "Law of Vision Representation" in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). It reveals a strong correlation between the combination of cross-modal alignment, correspondence in vision representation, and MLLM performance. The authors quantify the two factors using the cross-modal Alignment and Correspondence score (AC score). Through extensive experiments involving thirteen different vision representation settings and evaluations across eight benchmarks, the paper finds that the AC score is linearly correlated to model performance. By leveraging this relationship, the authors are able to identify and train the optimal vision representation only, which does not require finetuning the language model every time, resulting in a 99.7% reduction in computational cost.

3. ***HKUST and Huggingface on "LlamaDuo": <br>"LlamaDuo" is introduced as an LLMOps pipeline that enables migration from service-oriented LLMs to smaller, local models. This approach addresses challenges like operational failures, privacy concerns, and offline requirements. By iteratively fine-tuning smaller models with synthetic datasets from service LLMs, it ensures smaller models can match or surpass the capabilities of service LLMs for specific tasks.*** <br><br>
   Aug 29, HKUST and Huggingface published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13467) “LlamaDuo: LLMOps Pipeline for Seamless Migration from Service LLMs to Small-Scale Local LLMs”. The widespread adoption of cloud-based proprietary large language models (LLMs) has introduced significant challenges, including operational dependencies, privacy concerns, and the necessity of continuous internet connectivity. This paper introduces an LLMOps pipeline, "LlamaDuo", for the seamless migration of knowledge and abilities from service-oriented LLMs to smaller, locally manageable models. This pipeline is crucial for ensuring service continuity in the presence of operational failures, strict privacy policies, or offline requirements. LlamaDuo involves fine-tuning a small language model against the service LLM using a synthetic dataset generated by the latter. If the performance of the fine-tuned model falls short of expectations, it is enhanced by further fine-tuning with additional similar data created by the service LLM. This iterative process guarantees that the smaller model can eventually match or even surpass the service LLM's capabilities in specific downstream tasks, offering a practical and scalable solution for managing AI deployments in constrained environments. Extensive experiments with leading edge LLMs are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness, adaptability, and affordability of LlamaDuo across various downstream tasks.

The benchmark consists of 2,170 questions covering 23 graph properties, challenging current LMMs, with the top-performing model scoring only 21.7%. The goal is to push LMMs' capabilities in graph analysis.*** <br><br>
   Aug 29, Uni of Cambridge and the Uni of Hong Kong published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11817) “GRAB: A Challenging GRaph Analysis Benchmark for Large Multimodal Models”. Large multimodal models (LMMs) have exhibited proficiencies across many visual tasks. Although numerous well-known benchmarks exist to evaluate model performance, they increasingly have insufficient headroom. As such, there is a pressing need for a new generation of benchmarks challenging enough for the next generation of LMMs. One area that LMMs show potential is graph analysis, specifically, the tasks an analyst might typically perform when interpreting figures such as estimating the mean, intercepts or correlations of functions and data series. This paper introduces GRAB, a graph analysis benchmark, fit for current and future frontier LMMs. The benchmark is entirely synthetic, ensuring high-quality, noise-free questions. GRAB is comprised of 2170 questions, covering four tasks and 23 graph properties. The authors evaluate 20 LMMs on GRAB, finding it to be a challenging benchmark, with the highest performing model attaining a score of just 21.7%. Finally, the authors conduct various ablations to investigate where the models succeed and struggle. The authors [release GRAB](https://grab-benchmark.github.io/) to encourage progress in this important, growing domain.

It shows that concatenating visual tokens from multiple vision encoders is as effective as more complex architectures. The authors also introduce Pre-Alignment, improving model coherence and performance on major MLLM benchmarks, with the Eagle model family outperforming leading models.*** <br><br>
   Aug 28, Nvidia, Georgia Tech, UMD and HKPU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15998) “Eagle: Exploring The Design Space for Multimodal LLMs with Mixture of Encoders”. The ability to accurately interpret complex visual information is a crucial topic of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Recent work indicates that enhanced visual perception significantly reduces hallucinations and improves performance on resolution-sensitive tasks, such as optical character recognition and document analysis. A number of recent MLLMs achieve this goal using a mixture of vision encoders. Despite their success, there is a lack of systematic comparisons and detailed ablation studies addressing critical aspects, such as expert selection and the integration of multiple vision experts. This study provides an extensive exploration of the design space for MLLMs using a mixture of vision encoders and resolutions. The findings reveal several underlying principles common to various existing strategies, leading to a streamlined yet effective design approach. The paper discovers that simply concatenating visual tokens from a set of complementary vision encoders is as effective as more complex mixing architectures or strategies. The authors additionally introduce Pre-Alignment to bridge the gap between vision-focused encoders and language tokens, enhancing model coherence. The resulting family of MLLMs, Eagle, surpasses other leading open-source models on major MLLM benchmarks. Models and code: https://github.com/NVlabs/Eagle

This structured approach aids users in refining searches and discovering deeper knowledge across scientific domains.*** <br><br>
    Aug 28, Bar-Ilan and Allen Inst for AI published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15836) “Knowledge Navigator: LLM-guided Browsing Framework for Exploratory Search in Scientific Literature”. The exponential growth of scientific literature necessitates advanced tools for effective knowledge exploration.

11. ***Writer, Inc. on "Writing in the Margins": <br>"Writing in the Margins" (WiM) is a new inference pattern for improving LLM performance in long-context retrieval tasks. By segmenting and inferring information in chunks, it boosts accuracy by 7.5% for reasoning tasks and over 30% for aggregation tasks, without fine-tuning models. WiM is implemented using Hugging Face's Transformers library.*** <br><br>
    Aug 27, Writer, Inc. published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14906) “Writing in the Margins: Better Inference Pattern for Long Context Retrieval”. The paper introduces Writing in the Margins (WiM), a new inference pattern for Large Language Models designed to optimize the handling of long input sequences in retrieval-oriented tasks. This approach leverages the chunked prefill of the key-value cache to perform segment-wise inference, which enables efficient processing of extensive contexts along with the generation and classification of intermediate information ("margins") that guide the model towards specific tasks. This method increases computational overhead marginally while significantly enhancing the performance of off-the-shelf models without the need for fine-tuning. Specifically, the authors observe that WiM provides an average enhancement of 7.5% in accuracy for reasoning skills (HotpotQA, MultiHop-RAG) and more than a 30.0% increase in the F1-score for aggregation tasks (CWE). Additionally, the paper shows how the proposed pattern fits into an interactive retrieval design that provides end-users with ongoing updates about the progress of context processing, and pinpoints the integration of relevant information into the final response. The authors release the implementation of WiM using Hugging Face Transformers library at https://github.com/writer/writing-in-the-margins.

13. ***UC Berkeley and Stanford on "Text2SQL is Not Enough": <br>The "Table-Augmented Generation" (TAG) paradigm is introduced to expand the scope of natural language questions over databases, going beyond Text2SQL and Retrieval-Augmented Generation methods. TAG enables broader interactions between LMs and databases, offering new research opportunities in data query handling.*** <br><br>
    Aug 27, UC Berkeley and Stanford Uni. Published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14717) “Text2SQL is Not Enough: Unifying AI and Databases with TAG”. AI systems that serve natural language questions over databases promise to unlock tremendous value. Such systems would allow users to leverage the powerful reasoning and knowledge capabilities of language models (LMs) alongside the scalable computational power of data management systems. These combined capabilities would empower users to ask arbitrary natural language questions over custom data sources. However, existing methods and benchmarks insufficiently explore this setting. Text2SQL methods focus solely on natural language questions that can be expressed in relational algebra, representing a small subset of the questions real users wish to ask. Likewise, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) considers the limited subset of queries that can be answered with point lookups to one or a few data records within the database. The paper proposes Table-Augmented Generation (TAG), a unified and general-purpose paradigm for answering natural language questions over databases. The TAG model represents a wide range of interactions between the LM and database that have been previously unexplored and creates exciting research opportunities for leveraging the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LMs over data. The paper systematically develops benchmarks to study the TAG problem and find that standard methods answer no more than 20% of queries correctly, confirming the need for further research in this area. The authors release code for the benchmark at https://github.com/TAG-Research/TAG-Bench.

15. ***Cornell, Geneva, Together AI, and Princeton on "Mamba in the Llama": <br>This paper discusses distilling large Transformers into linear RNNs like Mamba. The hybrid model created, using a quarter of the original attention layers, matches or exceeds Transformer performance in chat benchmarks. The authors introduce a speculative decoding algorithm, improving the model's inference speed and deployment efficiency.*** <br><br>
    Aug 27, Uni of Cornell, Uni of Geneva, together AI and Uni of Princeton published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15237) “The Mamba in the Llama: Distilling and Accelerating Hybrid Models”. Linear RNN architectures, like Mamba, can be competitive with Transformer models in language modeling while having advantageous deployment characteristics. Given the focus on training large-scale Transformer models, the paper considers the challenge of converting these pretrained models for deployment. The paper demonstrates that it is feasible to distill large Transformers into linear RNNs by reusing the linear projection weights from attention layers with academic GPU resources. The resulting hybrid model, which incorporates a quarter of the attention layers, achieves performance comparable to the original Transformer in chat benchmarks and outperforms open-source hybrid Mamba models trained from scratch with trillions of tokens in both chat benchmarks and general benchmarks. Moreover, the work introduces a hardware-aware speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates the inference speed of Mamba and hybrid models. Overall the paper shows how, with limited computation resources, can remove many of the original attention layers and generate from the resulting model more efficiently. The top-performing model, distilled from Llama3-8B-Instruct, achieves a 29.61 length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2 against GPT-4 and 7.35 on MT-Bench, surpassing the best instruction-tuned linear RNN model.

17. ***Cerebras on "Cerebras Inference": <br>Cerebras introduces a new AI inference solution that delivers significantly faster token processing speeds and lower costs compared to NVIDIA-based solutions. Using its Wafer Scale Engine, Cerebras Inference handles Llama3 models at 20x the speed of GPU solutions, offering a scalable, cost-effective platform for high-speed inference.*** <br><br>
    Aug 27, Cerebras announced its [Cerebras Inference](https://cerebras.ai/blog/introducing-cerebrcas-inference-ai-at-instant-speed), “Introducing Cerebras Inference: AI at Instant Speed”.  Cerebras inference delivers 1,800 tokens per second for Llama3.1 8B and 450 tokens per second for Llama3.1 70B, which is 20x faster than NVIDIA GPU-based hyperscale clouds. Cerebras inference offers the industry’s best pricing at 10c per million tokens for Lama 3.1 8B and 60c per million tokens for Llama 3 70B. Cerebras inference is open to developers today via API access. Powered by the third generation Wafer Scale Engine, Cerebras inference runs Llama3.1 20x faster than GPU solutions at 1/5 the price. At 1,800 tokens/s, Cerebras Inference is 2.4x faster than Groq in Llama3.1-8B. For Llama3.1-70B, Cerebras is the only platform to enable instant responses at a blistering 450 tokens/sec. All this is achieved using native 16-bit weights for the model, ensuring the highest accuracy responses. Cerebras solves the memory bandwidth bottleneck by building the largest chip in the world and storing the entire model on-chip. With the unique wafer-scale design, Cerebrate is able to integrate 44GB of SRAM on a single chip – eliminating the need for external memory and for the slow lanes linking external memory to compute. In total, the WSE-3 has 21 petabytes/s of aggregate memory bandwidth – 7,000x that of an H100. It is the only AI chip with both petabyte-scale compute and petabyte-scale memory bandwidth, making it a near ideal design for high-speed inference.

This allows for more efficient and scalable training of large models on low-bandwidth networks, matching the performance of existing optimization methods.*** <br><br>
    Aug 26, Nous Research published its [report](https://github.com/NousResearch/DisTrO) “A Preliminary Report on DisTro”. Training large scale neural networks typically involves sharing gradients between all accelerators, which necessitates specialized, high-speed interconnects. To address this, the paper introduces DisTrO, a family of architecture-agnostic and network-agnostic distributed optimizers that reduces the inter-GPU communication requirements by four to five orders of magnitude without relying on amortized analysis, enabling low-latency training of large neural networks on slow internet bandwidths with heterogeneous networking hardware. In this preliminary report the authors are excited to show the first and earliest empirical proof that DisTrO-AdamW matches standard AdamW+All-Reduce in convergence rate while massively reducing the required bandwidth during pre-training of a 1.2B LLM. When using Distributed Data Parallelism, DisTrO may enable future large scale foundation model training to bypass the need for high-speed interconnects entirely.

21. ***University of Hong Kong and collaborators on Transformer Efficiency: <br>The paper presents a method for approximating gradients in multi-layer Transformers with near-linear time complexity. This approach significantly reduces the computational demands of training and inference, making it more efficient to handle large sequences and long-context language models.*** <br><br>
    Aug 23, Uni of HK, Uni of Wisconsin-Madison, Tsinghua Uni, and Adobe published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13233) “Multi-Layer Transformers Gradient Can be Approximated in Almost Linear Time”. The quadratic computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism of popular transformer architectures poses significant challenges for training and inference, particularly in terms of efficiency and memory requirements. Towards addressing these challenges, this paper introduces a novel fast computation method for gradient calculation in multi-layer transformer models. The approach enables the computation of gradients for the entire multi-layer transformer model in almost linear time n^{1+o(1)}, where n is the input sequence length. This breakthrough significantly reduces the computational bottleneck associated with the traditional quadratic time complexity. The theory holds for any loss function and maintains a bounded approximation error across the entire model. Furthermore, the analysis can hold when the multi-layer transformer model contains many practical sub-modules, such as residual connection, casual mask, and multi-head attention. By improving the efficiency of gradient computation in large language models, the authors hope that the work will facilitate the more effective training and deployment of long-context language models based on the theoretical results.

23. ***West Pharmaceutical, Stanford, and Amazon on "RoundTable": <br>"RoundTable" introduces a dynamic schema and contextual autocomplete system to enhance query precision in databases. By leveraging full-text search and suggesting queries based on data in the table, this framework improves LLM accuracy when interacting with complex datasets.*** <br><br>
    Aug 23 West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc., Stanford Uni, and Amazon published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12369v1) “RoundTable: Leveraging Dynamic Schema and Contextual Autocomplete for Enhanced Query Precision in Tabular Question Answering”. With advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), a major use case that has emerged is querying databases in plain English, translating user questions into executable database queries, which has improved significantly. However, real-world datasets often feature a vast array of attributes and complex values, complicating the LLMs task of accurately identifying relevant columns or values from natural language queries. Traditional methods cannot fully relay the datasets size and complexity to the LLM. To address these challenges, the paper proposes a novel framework that leverages Full-Text Search (FTS) on the input table. This approach not only enables precise detection of specific values and columns but also narrows the search space for language models, thereby enhancing query accuracy. Additionally, it supports a custom auto-complete feature that suggests queries based on the data in the table. This integration significantly refines the interaction between the user and complex datasets, offering a sophisticated solution to the limitations faced by current table querying capabilities. This work is accompanied by an application for both Mac and Windows platforms, which readers can try out themselves on their own data.

The method enables efficient distributed inference, achieving real-time generation for up to 720p videos and is expected to serve as a robust baseline for future research.*** <br><br>
   Aug 22, National Uni of Singapore, VideoSys and Purdue Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12588) “Real-Time Video Generation with Pyramid Attention Broadcast”. The paper presents Pyramid Attention Broadcast (PAB), a real-time, high quality and training-free approach for DiT-based video generation. The method is founded on the observation that attention difference in the diffusion process exhibits a U-shaped pattern, indicating significant redundancy. The authors mitigate this by broadcasting attention outputs to subsequent steps in a pyramid style. It applies different broadcast strategies to each attention based on their variance for best efficiency. The paper further introduces broadcast sequence parallel for more efficient distributed inference. PAB demonstrates superior results across three models compared to baselines, achieving real-time generation for up to 720p videos. The authors anticipate that this simple yet effective method will serve as a robust baseline and facilitate future research and application for video generation. <br><br>

Even with perfect retrieval, kNN-LMs fail at determining correct answers in complex tasks, suggesting a limit to their reasoning capabilities.*** <br><br>
   Aug 21, Cornell Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11815) “Great Memory, Shallow Reasoning: Limits of kNN-LMs”. K-nearest neighbor language models (kNN-LMs), which integrate retrieval with next-word prediction, have demonstrated strong performance in language modeling as well as downstream NLP benchmarks. These results have led researchers to argue that models trained on poor quality or outdated data could perform well by employing a kNN extension that has access to a higher-quality datastore. This work asks whether this improved ability to recall information really translates into downstream abilities. The paper extensively evaluates kNN-LMs on a diverse set of tasks, ranging from sentiment classification and commonsense reasoning to multi-hop reasoning. Results show that kNN-LMs excel at memory-intensive tasks, where utilizing the patterns in the input is sufficient for determining the output, but struggle with reasoning tasks that require integrating multiple pieces of information to derive new knowledge. The paper further demonstrates through oracle experiments and qualitative analysis that even with perfect retrieval, kNN-LMs still fail to determine the correct answers, placing an upper bound on their reasoning performance.

Xinyu significantly increases commentary creation efficiency without compromising quality, reducing the time needed from 4 hours to 20 minutes.*** <br><br>
   Aug 21, Zhejiang Uni etc published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11609) on KDD24 “Xinyu: An Efficient LLM-based System for Commentary Generation”. Commentary provides readers with a deep understanding of events by presenting diverse arguments and evidence. However, creating commentary is a time-consuming task, even for skilled commentators. Large language models (LLMs) have simplified the process of natural language generation, but their direct application in commentary creation still faces challenges due to unique task requirements. These requirements can be categorized into two levels: 1) fundamental requirements, which include creating well-structured and logically consistent narratives, and 2) advanced requirements, which involve generating quality arguments and providing convincing evidence. This paper introduces Xinyu, an efficient LLM-based system designed to assist commentators in generating Chinese commentaries. To meet the fundamental requirements, the paper deconstructs the generation process into sequential steps, proposing targeted strategies and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for each step. To address the advanced requirements, the paper presents an argument ranking model for arguments and establish a comprehensive evidence database that includes up-to-date events and classic books, thereby strengthening the substantiation of the evidence with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technology. To evaluate the generated commentaries more fairly, corresponding to the two-level requirements, the paper introduces a comprehensive evaluation metric that considers five distinct perspectives in commentary generation. The experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system. The paper also observes a significant increase in the efficiency of commentators in real-world scenarios, with the average time spent on creating a commentary dropping from 4 hours to 20 minutes. Importantly, such an increase in efficiency does not compromise the quality of the commentaries. <br><br>

Transfusion models, pre-trained on a mixture of text and image data, show improved scaling and performance, offering benefits for both image and text generation, particularly when scaled to 7B parameters and 2T multi-modal tokens.*** <br><br>
    Aug 20, Meta, Waymo and Uni of Southern California published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11039) “Transfusion: Predict the Next Token and Diffuse Images with One Multi-Modal Model”. The paper introduces Transfusion, a recipe for training a multi-modal model over discrete and continuous data. Transfusion combines the language modeling loss function (next token prediction) with diffusion to train a single transformer over mixed-modality sequences. The authors pretrain multiple Transfusion models up to 7B parameters from scratch on a mixture of text and image data, establishing scaling laws with respect to a variety of uni- and cross-modal benchmarks. The experiments show that Transfusion scales significantly better than quantizing images and training a language model over discrete image tokens. By introducing modality-specific encoding and decoding layers, The study can further improve the performance of Transfusion models, and even compress each image to just 16 patches. The authors further demonstrate that scaling the Transfusion recipe to 7B parameters and 2T multi-modal tokens produces a model that can generate images and text on a par with similar scale diffusion models and language models, reaping the benefits of both worlds. <br><br>

11. ***"Impact of Code in LLM Pre-training: A Systematic Analysis": This paper investigates the impact of including code data in LLM pre-training, finding that code significantly enhances performance across a broad range of tasks beyond coding. The inclusion of code data results in notable improvements in natural language reasoning, world knowledge, generative win-rates, and code performance, highlighting the value of preserving code in pre-training.*** <br><br>
    Aug 20, Cohere published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10914) “To Code, or Not To Code? Exploring Impact of Code in Pre-training”. Including code in the pre-training data mixture, even for models not specifically designed for code, has become a common practice in LLMs pre-training. While there has been anecdotal consensus among practitioners that code data plays a vital role in general LLMs' performance, there is only limited work analyzing the precise impact of code on non-code tasks. This paper systematically investigates the impact of code data on general performance. The research asks "what is the impact of code data used in pre-training on a large variety of downstream tasks beyond code generation". The authors conduct extensive ablations and evaluate across a broad range of natural language reasoning tasks, world knowledge tasks, code benchmarks, and LLM-as-a-judge win-rates for models with sizes ranging from 470M to 2.8B parameters. Across settings, the paper finds a consistent results that code is a critical building block for generalization far beyond coding tasks and improvements to code quality have an outsized impact across all tasks. In particular, compared to text-only pre-training, the addition of code results in up to relative increase of 8.2% in natural language (NL) reasoning, 4.2% in world knowledge, 6.6% improvement in generative win-rates, and a 12x boost in code performance respectively. The work suggests investments in code quality and preserving code during pre-training have positive impacts. <br><br>

13. ***"Ferret: Faster and Effective Automated Red Teaming": <br>The paper introduces Ferret, a new method for automated red teaming that builds upon Rainbow Teaming by generating multiple adversarial prompt mutations and ranking them with a reward-based scoring technique. Ferret achieves a 95% attack success rate, improving efficiency and effectiveness in generating adversarial prompts for large language models.*** <br><br>
    Aug 20, Singapore Uni of Tech and Design published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10701) “Ferret: Faster and Effective Automated Red Teaming with Reward-Based Scoring Technique”. In today's era, where large language models (LLMs) are integrated into numerous real-world applications, ensuring their safety and robustness is crucial for responsible AI usage. Automated red-teaming methods play a key role in this process by generating adversarial attacks to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in these models. However, existing methods often struggle with slow performance, limited categorical diversity, and high resource demands. While Rainbow Teaming, a recent approach, addresses the diversity challenge by framing adversarial prompt generation as a quality-diversity search, it remains slow and requires a large fine-tuned mutator for optimal performance. To overcome these limitations, the paper proposes Ferret, a novel approach that builds upon Rainbow Teaming by generating multiple adversarial prompt mutations per iteration and using a scoring function to rank and select the most effective adversarial prompt. The authors explore various scoring functions, including reward models, Llama Guard, and LLM-as-a-judge, to rank adversarial mutations based on their potential harm to improve the efficiency of the search for harmful mutations. The results demonstrate that Ferret, utilizing a reward model as a scoring function, improves the overall attack success rate (ASR) to 95%, which is 46% higher than Rainbow Teaming. Additionally, Ferret reduces the time needed to achieve a 90% ASR by 15.2% compared to the baseline and generates adversarial prompts that are transferable i.e. effective on other LLMs of larger size. The codes are available at https://github.com/declare-lab/ferret. <br><br>

15. ***"Challenges with Dataset Construction in Computer Vision": <br>The paper argues that constructing representative image datasets for model testing is statistically implausible, making performance metrics unreliable for real-world deployment. The authors recommend focusing on assessing models' decision-making processes rather than accuracy metrics, as larger datasets or bias-aware datasets do not solve this issue.*** <br><br>
    Aug 20, McGill Uni and York University published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11160) “Statistical Challenges with Dataset Construction: Why You Will Never Have Enough Images”.  Deep neural networks have achieved impressive performance on many computer vision benchmarks in recent years. However, can we be confident that impressive performance on benchmarks will translate to strong performance in real-world environments? Many environments in the real world are safety critical, and even slight model failures can be catastrophic. Therefore, it is crucial to test models rigorously before deployment. The authors argue, through both statistical theory and empirical evidence, that selecting representative image datasets for testing a model is likely implausible in many domains. Furthermore, performance statistics calculated with non-representative image datasets are highly unreliable. As a consequence, there is no guarantee that models which perform well on withheld test images will also perform well in the real world. Creating larger and larger datasets will not help, and bias aware datasets cannot solve this problem either. Ultimately, there is little statistical foundation for evaluating models using withheld test sets. The paper recommends that future evaluation methodologies focus on assessing a model's decision-making process, rather than metrics such as accuracy. <br><br>

17. ***"Plan-based Retrieval for Grounded Text Generation": <br>This study examines how planning can guide retrieval to reduce hallucinations in text generation. By improving the coverage of relevant facts, the proposed plan-guided retrieval approach enhances the informativeness and attribution of generated responses, offering a promising method to mitigate hallucinations in language models.*** <br><br>
    Aug 20, Uni of Southern California and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10490) “Analysis of Plan-based Retrieval for Grounded Text Generation”. In text generation, hallucinations refer to the generation of seemingly coherent text that contradicts established knowledge. One compelling hypothesis is that hallucinations occur when a language model is given a generation task outside its parametric knowledge (due to rarity, recency, domain, etc.). A common strategy to address this limitation is to infuse the language models with retrieval mechanisms, providing the model with relevant knowledge for the task. This paper leverages the planning capabilities of instruction-tuned LLMs and analyzes how planning can be used to guide retrieval to further reduce the frequency of hallucinations. The authors empirically evaluate several variations of the proposed approach on long-form text generation tasks. By improving the coverage of relevant facts, plan-guided retrieval and generation can produce more informative responses while providing a higher rate of attribution to source documents. <br><br>

19. ***"KAN 2.0: Bridging AI and Science with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks": <br>The paper introduces a framework to integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with scientific discovery, enhancing their ability to identify features, modular structures, and symbolic formulas. The framework allows for a bidirectional synergy between KANs and scientific knowledge, demonstrating KANs' potential in discovering various physical laws.*** <br><br>
    Aug 19, MIT, California Inst of Tech and NSF published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10205) “KAN 2.0: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks Meet Science”. A major challenge of AI + Science lies in their inherent incompatibility: today's AI is primarily based on connectionism, while science depends on symbolism. To bridge the two worlds, the paper proposes a framework to seamlessly synergize Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and science. The framework highlights KANs' usage for three aspects of scientific discovery: identifying relevant features, revealing modular structures, and discovering symbolic formulas. The synergy is bidirectional: science to KAN (incorporating scientific knowledge into KANs), and KAN to science (extracting scientific insights from KANs). The authors highlight major new functionalities in the pykan package: (1) MultKAN: KANs with multiplication nodes. (2) kanpiler: a KAN compiler that compiles symbolic formulas into KANs. (3) tree converter: convert KANs (or any neural networks) to tree graphs. Based on these tools, the authors demonstrate KANs' capability to discover various types of physical laws, including conserved quantities, Lagrangians, symmetries, and constitutive laws.<br><br>

21. ***"Generative AI Hype and Its Practical Evolution": <br>The article discusses the gradual evolution of generative AI technology, emphasizing the shift from hype to practical utility. It highlights the emergence of smaller, more efficient models, the increasing focus on AI literacy, and the continuous improvement of generative AI, suggesting that AI will gradually transform human activities rather than replace them.*** <br><br>
    Aug 19, TheConversation.com published an [article](https://theconversation.com/generative-ai-hype-is-ending-and-now-the-technology-might-actually-become-useful-236940) “Generative AI hype is ending – and now the technology might actually become useful”. Large language models such as GPT-4 do not always match what people expect of them, such as the [experimental results](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01382) from Harvard Uni etc. Experience from successful projects shows it is also tough to make a generative model follow instructions. However, GenAI hype isn’t over yet because first generative AI technology, despite its challenges, is rapidly improving, with scale and size being the primary drivers of the improvement. Second, studies have found sufficiently complex large language models can develop the ability to reason by analogy and even reproduce optical illusions like those experienced by humans. Next, 1) AI is being used to support humans, rather than replace them. 2) we also see a rise in [smaller (and cheaper) generative AI models](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-08/move-over-llms-small-ai-models-are-the-next-big-thing), trained on specific data and deployed locally to reduce costs and optimise efficiency. Even OpenAI, which has led the race for ever-larger models, has released the GPT-4o Mini model to reduce costs and improve performance. 3) we see a strong focus on providing AI literacy training and educating the workforce on how AI works, its potentials and limitations, and best practices for ethical AI use. Therefore, the AI revolution will look more like an evolution. Its use will gradually grow over time and, little by little, alter and transform human activities. Which is much better than replacing them. <br><br>

23. ***"IDEA: Enhancing Rule Learning in Interactive Environments": <br>The paper introduces IDEA, an agent designed to improve rule-learning abilities in large language models through induction, deduction, and abduction processes. Evaluated on the RULEARN benchmark, IDEA shows improved performance in interactive settings, offering insights for developing agents capable of human-like rule learning.*** <br><br>
    Aug 19, Uni of Texas at Dallas published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10455) “IDEA: Enhancing the rule learning ability of language agent through Induction, DEuction, and Abduction”. While large language models (LLMs) have been thoroughly evaluated for deductive and inductive reasoning, their proficiency in abductive reasoning and holistic rule learning in interactive environments remains less explored. This work introduces RULEARN, a novel benchmark specifically designed to assess the rule-learning ability of LLMs in interactive settings. In RULEARN, agents interact with the environment to gather observations and discern patterns, using these insights to solve problems. To further enhance the rule-learning capabilities of LLM agents within this benchmark, the paper proposes IDEA agent, which integrates Induction, Deduction, and Abduction processes. IDEA agent refines this approach by leveraging a structured reasoning sequence: generating hypotheses through abduction, testing them via deduction, and refining them based on induction feedback. This sequence enables agents to dynamically establish and apply rules, mimicking human-like reasoning processes. The evaluation of five representative LLMs indicates that while these models can generate plausible initial hypotheses, they often struggle with strategic interaction within the environment, effective incorporation of feedback, and adaptive refinement of their hypotheses. IDEA agent demonstrates significantly improved performance on the RULEARN benchmark, offering valuable insights for the development of agents capable of human-like rule-learning in real-world scenarios. We will release our code and data. <br><br>

25. ***"In-Context Learning with Transformers: A Theoretical Analysis": <br>This paper explores the training dynamics of transformers in in-context learning (ICL), showing that transformers can generalize to unseen examples by learning template functions in-context. The study provides a theoretical foundation for understanding ICL and demonstrates that transformers can effectively perform ridge regression over basis functions.*** <br><br>
    Aug 19, CMU, Upenn et al. published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10147) “In-Context Learning with Representations: Contextual Generalization of Trained Transformers”. In-context learning (ICL) refers to a remarkable capability of pretrained large language models, which can learn a new task given a few examples during inference. However, theoretical understanding of ICL is largely under-explored, particularly whether transformers can be trained to generalize to unseen examples in a prompt, which will require the model to acquire contextual knowledge of the prompt for generalization. This paper investigates the training dynamics of transformers by gradient descent through the lens of non-linear regression tasks. The contextual generalization here can be attained via learning the template function for each task in-context, where all template functions lie in a linear space with m basis functions. The paper analyzes the training dynamics of one-layer multi-head transformers to in-contextly predict unlabeled inputs given partially labeled prompts, where the labels contain Gaussian noise and the number of examples in each prompt are not sufficient to determine the template. Under mild assumptions, the paper shows that the training loss for a one-layer multi-head transformer converges linearly to a global minimum. Moreover, the transformer effectively learns to perform ridge regression over the basis functions. To the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first provable demonstration that transformers can learn contextual (i.e., template) information to generalize to both unseen examples and tasks when prompts contain only a small number of query-answer pairs. <br><br>

27. ***"xGen-MM (BLIP-3): Open Large Multimodal Models Framework": <br>The report introduces xGen-MM, a framework for developing large multimodal models that expands on Salesforce's xGen initiative. The models show strong in-context learning capabilities, competitive performance, and improved safety, with all resources made publicly available to advance research in multimodal models.*** <br><br>
    Aug 16, Salesforce and Uni of Washington published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08872) “xGen-MM (BLIP-3): A Family of Open Large Multimodal Models”. This report introduces xGen-MM (also known as BLIP-3), a framework for developing Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). The framework comprises meticulously curated datasets, a training recipe, model architectures, and a resulting suite of LMMs. xGen-MM, short for xGen-MultiModal, expands the Salesforce xGen initiative on foundation AI models. The models undergo rigorous evaluation across a range of tasks, including both single and multi-image benchmarks. The pre-trained base model exhibits strong in-context learning capabilities and the instruction-tuned model demonstrates competitive performance among open-source LMMs with similar model sizes. In addition, the paper introduces a safety-tuned model with DPO, aiming to mitigate harmful behaviors such as hallucinations and improve safety. The authors open source the models, curated large-scale datasets, and the fine-tuning codebase to facilitate further advancements in LMM research. Associated resources will be available on the project page. <br><br>

29. ***"Cybench: Evaluating Cybersecurity Capabilities of Language Models": <br>The paper presents Cybench, a framework for evaluating language models' cybersecurity capabilities through professional-level Capture the Flag (CTF) tasks. The evaluation reveals that current models struggle with complex tasks, but subtasks improve performance measurement, highlighting the need for further research in cybersecurity-focused language models.*** <br><br>
    Aug 15, Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08926) “Cybench: A Framework for Evaluating Cybersecurity Capabilities and Risk of Language Models”. Language Model (LM) agents for cybersecurity that are capable of autonomously identifying vulnerabilities and executing exploits have the potential to cause real-world impact. Policymakers, model providers, and other researchers in the AI and cybersecurity communities are interested in quantifying the capabilities of such agents to help mitigate cyberrisk and investigate opportunities for penetration testing. Toward that end, the paper introduces Cybench, a framework for specifying cybersecurity tasks and evaluating agents on those tasks. The authors include 40 professional-level Capture the Flag (CTF) tasks from 4 distinct CTF competitions, chosen to be recent, meaningful, and spanning a wide range of difficulties. Each task includes its own description, starter files, and is initialized in an environment where an agent can execute bash commands and observe outputs. Since many tasks are beyond the capabilities of existing LM agents, the paper introduces subtasks, which break down a task into intermediary steps for more gradated evaluation; adds subtasks for 17 of the 40 tasks. To evaluate agent capabilities, the authors construct a cybersecurity agent and evaluate 7 models: GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mixtral 8x22b Instruct, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B Chat, and Llama 3.1 405B Instruct. Without guidance, the research finds that agents are able to solve only the easiest complete tasks that took human teams up to 11 minutes to solve, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o having the highest success rates. Finally, subtasks provide more signal for measuring performance compared to unguided runs, with models achieving a 3.2\% higher success rate on complete tasks with subtask-guidance than without subtask-guidance. All code and data are publicly available at https://cybench.github.io <br><br>

31. ***"Automated Design of Agentic Systems (ADAS): A New Research Area": <br>The paper introduces ADAS, a research area focused on automatically creating powerful agentic systems by combining novel building blocks and programming agents in code. The Meta Agent Search algorithm demonstrates the potential for automatically designing high-performing agents, offering a new direction for AI research and development.*** <br><br>
    Aug 15, Uni of British Columbia, Vector Inst. And CIFAR AI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08435) “Automated Design of Agentic Systems”. Researchers are investing substantial effort in developing powerful general-purpose agents, wherein Foundation Models are used as modules within agentic systems (e.g. Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, Toolformer). However, the history of machine learning teaches us that hand-designed solutions are eventually replaced by learned solutions. The research formulates a new research area, Automated Design of Agentic Systems (ADAS), which aims to automatically create powerful agentic system designs, including inventing novel building blocks and/or combining them in new ways. The work further demonstrates that there is an unexplored yet promising approach within ADAS where agents can be defined in code and new agents can be automatically discovered by a meta agent programming ever better ones in code. Given that programming languages are Turing Complete, this approach theoretically enables the learning of any possible agentic system: including novel prompts, tool use, control flows, and combinations thereof. The paper presents a simple yet effective algorithm named Meta Agent Search to demonstrate this idea, where a meta agent iteratively programs interesting new agents based on an ever-growing archive of previous discoveries. Through extensive experiments across multiple domains including coding, science, and math, the research shows that the proposed algorithm can progressively invent agents with novel designs that greatly outperform state-of-the-art hand-designed agents. Importantly, the authors consistently observe the surprising result that agents invented by Meta Agent Search maintain superior performance even when transferred across domains and models, demonstrating their robustness and generality. Provided the authors develop it safely, the work illustrates the potential of an exciting new research direction toward automatically designing ever-more powerful agentic systems to benefit humanity.

3. ***Google's Visual Memory Innovation: <br>Google published a paper "Towards flexible perception with visual memory," proposing a novel approach to neural network training. Instead of the traditional monolithic model, this method combines the power of deep learning with a flexible database structure. It allows for scalable data integration, data removal, and interpretable decision-making, challenging the idea that neural networks must be static and unchangeable once trained.***<br>

   Aug 15, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08172) “Towards flexible perception with visual memory”.  Training a neural network is a monolithic endeavor, akin to carving knowledge into stone: once the process is completed, editing the knowledge in a network is nearly impossible, since all information is distributed across the network's weights. The paper explores a simple, compelling alternative by marrying the representational power of deep neural networks with the flexibility of a database. Decomposing the task of image classification into image similarity (from a pre-trained embedding) and search (via fast nearest neighbor retrieval from a knowledge database), the work builds a simple and flexible visual memory that has the following key capabilities: (1.) The ability to flexibly add data across scales: from individual samples all the way to entire classes and billion-scale data; (2.) The ability to remove data through unlearning and memory pruning; (3.) An interpretable decision-mechanism on which the authors can intervene to control its behavior. Taken together, these capabilities comprehensively demonstrate the benefits of an explicit visual memory. The authors hope that it might contribute to a conversation on how knowledge should be represented in deep vision models -- beyond carving it in “stone” weights.<br><br>

5. ***Study on Language Models and Hallucinations: <br>Google's paper explores how training language models (LMs) on knowledge graphs affects their hallucination tendencies. The research reveals that larger, longer-trained LMs hallucinate less, but controlling hallucinations at scale is costly. Interestingly, as models grow, hallucinations become harder to detect, indicating a complex relationship between model size and performance.***<br>

   Aug 14, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07852v1) “Training Language Models on the Knowledge Graph: Insights on Hallucinations and Their Detectability”. While many capabilities of language models (LMs) improve with increased training budget, the influence of scale on hallucinations is not yet fully understood. Hallucinations come in many forms, and there is no universally accepted definition. The study thus focuses on studying only those hallucinations where a correct answer appears verbatim in the training set. To fully control the training data content, the authors construct a knowledge graph (KG)-based dataset, and use it to train a set of increasingly large LMs. The study finds that for a fixed dataset, larger and longer-trained LMs hallucinate less. However, hallucinating on <= 5% of the training data requires an order of magnitude larger model, and thus an order of magnitude more compute, than Hoffmann et al. (2022) reported was optimal. Given this costliness, the authors study how hallucination detectors depend on scale. While the study sees detector size improves performance on fixed LM's outputs, it is found an inverse relationship between the scale of the LM and the detectability of its hallucinations.<br><br>

7. ***MIT's AI Risk Repository: <br>MIT's AI Risk Repository is a comprehensive database and taxonomy of 777 AI risks, aimed at unifying the understanding and management of AI-related dangers. It classifies risks by causal factors and domains, providing a detailed framework to help policymakers, researchers, and developers navigate the complex landscape of AI safety.***<br>

   Aug 14, MIT release an [AI Risk Repository](https://airisk.mit.edu/) with a [paper](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/669550d38372f33552d2516e/66bc918b580467717e194940_The%20AI%20Risk%20Repository_13_8_2024.pdf) “The AI Risk Repository: A Comprehensive Meta-Review, Database, and Taxonomy of Risks From Artificial Intelligence”. The risks posed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) are of considerable concern to academics, auditors, policymakers, AI companies, and the public. However, a lack of shared understanding of AI risks can impede our ability to comprehensively discuss, research, and react to them. This paper addresses this gap by creating an AI Risk Repository to serve as a common frame of reference. This comprises a living database of 777 risks extracted from 43 taxonomies, which can be filtered based on two overarching taxonomies and easily accessed, modified, and updated via the authors’ [website](https://airisk.mit.edu/) and [online spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1evwjF4XmpykycpeZFq0FUteEAt7awx2i2oE6kMrV_xE/copy). The authors construct a Repository with a systematic review of taxonomies and other structured classifications of AI risk followed by an expert consultation. The study develops the taxonomies of AI risk using a best-fit framework synthesis. The high-level Causal Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies each risk by its causal factors (1) Entity: Human, AI; (2) Intentionality: Intentional, Unintentional; and (3) Timing: Pre-deployment; Post-deployment. The mid-level Domain Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies risks into seven AI risk domains: (1) Discrimination & toxicity, (2) Privacy & security, (3) Misinformation, (4) Malicious actors & misuse, (5) Human-computer interaction, (6) Socioeconomic & environmental, and (7) AI system safety, failures, & limitations. These are further divided into 23 subdomains. The AI Risk Repository is, to authors’ knowledge, the first attempt to rigorously curate, analyze, and extract AI risk frameworks into a publicly accessible, comprehensive, extensible, and categorized risk database. This creates a foundation for a more coordinated, coherent, and complete approach to defining, auditing, and managing the risks posed by AI systems.<br><br>

9. ***Advancements in Text-to-SQL Pipelines: <br>A paper by Distyl AI and Polytechnique Montreal questioned the necessity of schema linking in Text-to-SQL pipelines. The research found that modern language models can bypass this step, directly identifying relevant schema elements, which improves accuracy and simplifies the pipeline.***<br>

    Aug 14, Distyl AI and Polytechnique Montreal published a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07702) “The Death of Schema Linking? Text-to-SQL in the Age of Well-Reasoned Language Models”. Schema linking is a crucial step in Text-to-SQL pipelines, which translate natural language queries into SQL. The goal of schema linking is to retrieve relevant tables and columns (signal) while disregarding irrelevant ones (noise). However, imperfect schema linking can often exclude essential columns needed for accurate query generation. This work revisits the need for schema linking when using the latest generation of large language models (LLMs). The work finds empirically that newer models are adept at identifying relevant schema elements during generation, without the need for explicit schema linking. This allows Text-to-SQL pipelines to bypass schema linking entirely and instead pass the full database schema to the LLM, eliminating the risk of excluding necessary information. Furthermore, as alternatives to schema linking, the authors propose techniques that improve Text-to-SQL accuracy without compromising on essential schema information. This approach achieves 71.83\% execution accuracy on the BIRD benchmark, ranking first at the time of submission.<br><br>

This method integrates guided Monte Carlo Tree Search with a self-critique mechanism, enabling AI agents to improve their performance in tasks like web navigation and real-world booking scenarios.***<br>

    Aug 13, MultiOn and Stanford Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07199) “Agent Q: Advanced Reasoning and Learning for Autonomous AI Agents”. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language tasks requiring complex reasoning, yet their application in agentic, multi-step reasoning within interactive environments remains a difficult challenge. Traditional supervised pre-training on static datasets falls short in enabling autonomous agent capabilities needed to perform complex decision-making in dynamic settings like web navigation. Previous attempts to bridge this gap through supervised fine-tuning on curated expert demonstrations often suffer from compounding errors and limited exploration data, resulting in sub-optimal policy outcomes. To overcome these challenges, the work proposes a framework that combines guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) search with a self-critique mechanism and iterative fine-tuning on agent interactions using an off-policy variant of the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm. The method allows LLM agents to learn effectively from both successful and unsuccessful trajectories, thereby improving their generalization in complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. The authors validate the approach in the WebShop environment, a simulated e-commerce platform—where it consistently outperforms behavior cloning and reinforced fine-tuning baseline, and beats average human performance when equipped with the capability to do online search. In real-world booking scenarios, the methodology boosts Llama-3 70B model’s zero-shot performance from 18.6% to 81.7% success rate (a 340% relative increase) after a single day of data collection and further to 95.4% with online search. The authors believe this represents a substantial leap forward in the capabilities of autonomous agents, paving the way for more sophisticated and reliable decision-making in real-world settings.<br><br>

13. ***xAI's Grok-2 Model Preview: <br>xAI released an early preview of Grok-2, a new AI model with enhanced capabilities in chat, coding, and reasoning. Grok-2 outperforms several leading models on various benchmarks and excels in tasks like visual math reasoning and document-based question answering.***<br>

    Aug 13, [xAI released Grok-2](https://x.ai/blog/grok-2), an early preview of Grok-2, a significant step forward from its previous model Grok-1.5, featuring frontier capabilities in chat, coding, and reasoning. At the same time, xAI is introducing Grok-2 mini, a small but capable sibling of Grok-2. An early version of Grok-2 has been tested on the LMSYS leaderboard under the name "sus-column-r." At the time of this blog post, it is outperforming both Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4-Turbo. Internally, xAI employs a comparable process to evaluate the models. xAI’s AI Tutors engage with the models across a variety of tasks that reflect real-world interactions with Grok. During each interaction, the AI Tutors are presented with two responses generated by Grok. They select the superior response based on specific criteria outlined in the guidelines. xAI focused on evaluating model capabilities in two key areas: following instructions and providing accurate, factual information. Grok-2 has shown significant improvements in reasoning with retrieved content and in its tool use capabilities, such as correctly identifying missing information, reasoning through sequences of events, and discarding irrelevant posts. Grok-2 achieves performance levels competitive to other frontier models in areas such as graduate-level science knowledge (GPQA), general knowledge (MMLU, MMLU-Pro), and math competition problems (MATH). Additionally, Grok-2 excels in vision-based tasks, delivering state-of-the-art performance in visual math reasoning (MathVista) and in document-based question answering (DocVQA).<br><br>

15. ***Google's Imagen 3 Release: <br>Google introduced Imagen 3, a latent diffusion model that generates high-quality images from text prompts. While the model is preferred over other state-of-the-art models in terms of quality, the release includes discussions on safety and responsibility, although detailed information and model weights were not disclosed.***<br>

    Aug 13, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07009) “Imagen 3” to introduce Imagen 3, a latent diffusion model that generates high quality images from text prompts. The paper describes the quality and responsibility evaluations. Imagen 3 is preferred over other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models at the time of evaluation. In addition, the paper discusses issues around safety and representation, as well as methods we used to minimize the potential harm of our models. But it looks like no much details are released in the paper, and model weights are not released neither.<br><br>

17. ***Evolution of AI Agents: <br>An article by venturebeat discusses the shift from AI assistants to proactive, autonomous agents. These agents are capable of making independent decisions and handling complex tasks, signaling a significant evolution in AI. While promising, the article notes that the infrastructure to support these agents is still under development, and organizations must address challenges like data quality and trust.***<br>

    Aug 13, [venturebeat.com](https://venturebeat.com/ai/beyond-assistants-ai-agents-are-transforming-the-paradigm/) published an article “Beyond assistants: AI agents are transforming the paradigm”. The article discusses the evolution of AI from reactive assistants to proactive, autonomous agents. By 2028, a significant portion of human interactions with AI is expected to shift from prompting large language models (LLMs) to interfacing with intent-driven agents. Unlike AI assistants that respond to user requests, these agents can make decisions and act independently, handling complex tasks in real time. This shift is seen as the next step in generative AI, with major tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and AWS already developing such agents. AI agents are compared to specialized employees who collaborate to solve business problems. They are already showing success in areas like customer service and marketing, and their use is expected to expand across various industries. However, the infrastructure needed to support these agents, such as a system for seamless communication and coordination between them, is still in development. Organizations looking to adopt AI agents must first overcome challenges associated with generative AI, such as data quality and managing trust and security issues. Starting with simple, well-defined use cases and focusing on data hygiene are recommended steps. As LLMs improve and more industries adopt AI agents, the benefits of this technology are expected to become more widespread, positioning organizations to fully leverage the potential of agentic AI.<br><br>

19. ***AI Scientist Framework for Autonomous Research: <br>A paper by Sakana AI and partners introduces "The AI Scientist," a framework for fully automated scientific discovery. The AI can generate research ideas, conduct experiments, and write scientific papers, potentially transforming the research process by reducing costs and increasing creativity.***<br>

    Aug 12, Sakana AI, FLAIR, Uni of Oxford, Uni of British Columbia et al. published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06292) “The AI Scientist: Towards Fully Automated Open-Ended Scientific Discovery”. One of the grand challenges of artificial general intelligence is developing agents capable of conducting scientific research and discovering new knowledge. While frontier models have already been used as aids to human scientists, e.g. for brainstorming ideas, writing code, or prediction tasks, they still conduct only a small part of the scientific process. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling frontier large language models to perform research independently and communicate their findings. The paper introduces The AI Scientist, which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results, describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a simulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can be repeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like the human scientific community. The work demonstrates its versatility by applying it to three distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling, transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics. Each idea is implemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than $15 per paper. To evaluate the generated papers, the authors design and validate an automated reviewer, which the authors show achieves near-human performance in evaluating paper scores. The AI Scientist can produce papers that exceed the acceptance threshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by the automated reviewer. This approach signifies the beginning of a new era in scientific discovery in machine learning: bringing the transformative benefits of AI agents to the entire research process of AI itself, and taking people closer to a world where endless affordable creativity and innovation can be unleashed on the world's most challenging problems.

21. ***Falcon Mamba 7B: A Revolutionary SSLM: <br>TII released Falcon Mamba 7B, the first open-source State Space Language Model (SSLM), noted for its low memory cost and superior performance over traditional models like Meta's Llama 3.1. This model reflects Abu Dhabi's innovation in AI research and is expected to be included in future Hugging Face releases.***<br>

    Aug 12, TII released first SSLM with [Falcon Mamba 7B](https://falconllm.tii.ae/tii-releases-first-sslm-with-falcon-mamba-7b.html) model. Falcon Mamba 7B is the first open source released State Space Language Model (SSLM), a new revolutionary architecture for Falcon models. Falcon Mamba 7B is the no. 1 globally performing open source SSLM in the world, as independently verified by Hugging Face. SSLMs have a low memory cost and don’t require additional memory to generate arbitrary long blocks of text. Falcon Mamba 7B also outperforms traditional transformer architecture models such as Meta’s Llama 3.1 8B and Mistral’s 7B. New model reflects the innovation and pioneering approach of Abu Dhabi in AI research and development. Falcon Mamba was trained with ~ 5500GT of data, mainly composed of RefinedWeb data with addition of high-quality technical data and code data from public sources. TII used constant learning rate for the most of the training, followed by a relatively short learning rate decay stage. In this last stage, TII also added a small portion of high-quality curated data to further enhance model performance. The Falcon Mamba architecture will be available in the next release of the Hugging Face transformers library (>4.45.0).<br><br>

23. ***Mutual Reasoning in Small Language Models: <br>A paper by Microsoft and Harvard introduces rStar, a method that enhances reasoning in small language models through mutual reasoning and self-play. This approach significantly improves problem-solving accuracy across various benchmarks, making smaller models more effective without requiring extensive fine-tuning.***<br>

    Aug 12, Microsoft and Harvard Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06195) “Mutual Reasoning Makes Smaller LLMs Stronger Problem-Solvers”. This paper introduces rStar, a self-play mutual reasoning approach that significantly improves reasoning capabilities of small language models (SLMs) without fine-tuning or superior models. rStar decouples reasoning into a self-play mutual generation-discrimination process. First, a target SLM augments the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a rich set of human-like reasoning actions to construct higher quality reasoning trajectories. Next, another SLM, with capabilities similar to the target SLM, acts as a discriminator to verify each trajectory generated by the target SLM. The mutually agreed reasoning trajectories are considered mutual consistent, thus are more likely to be correct. Extensive experiments across five SLMs demonstrate rStar can effectively solve diverse reasoning problems, including GSM8K, GSM-Hard, MATH, SVAMP, and StrategyQA. Remarkably, rStar boosts GSM8K accuracy from 12.51% to 63.91% for LLaMA2-7B, from 36.46% to 81.88% for Mistral-7B, from 74.53% to 91.13% for LLaMA3-8B-Instruct. Code will be available at https://github.com/zhentingqi/rStar.<br><br>

25. ***Debunking Emergent Abilities in LLMs: <br>A paper challenges the notion that large language models develop complex intelligent behaviors, attributing their performance to in-context learning rather than true emergent abilities. The study emphasizes that despite improvements, LLMs still require explicit instructions to perform tasks effectively.***<br>

    Aug 12, [techxplore.com](https://techxplore.com/news/2024-08-emergent-abilities-large-language-context.html) published an article introduced an ACL 2024 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.01809) “Are Emergent Abilities in Large Language Models just In-Context Learning?”.  According to the study, there is no evidence that what are known as large language models (LLMs) are beginning to develop a general "intelligent" behavior that would enable them to proceed in a planned or intuitive manner or to think in a complex way. The research focuses on unforeseen and sudden leaps in the performance of language models, which are referred to as "emergent abilities." After the models were introduced, scientists found that they became more powerful with increasing size and the growing amount of data with which they were trained (scaling). On the one hand, this raised hopes that further scaling would make the models even better. On the other hand, there was also concern that these abilities could become dangerous, as the LLMs could become independent and possibly escape human control. In response, AI laws were introduced worldwide, including in the European Union and the U.S.. However, the authors of the current study have now come to the conclusion that there is no evidence for the presumed development of differentiated thinking in the models. Instead, the LLMs acquired the superficial skill of following relatively simple instructions, as the researchers showed. The systems are still a long way from what humans are capable of. Users should explicitly state what the systems should do and, if possible, give examples. The important thing is: The tendency of these models to produce plausible-sounding but false results—known as confabulation—is likely to persist, even if the quality of the models has improved dramatically in recent times.<br><br>

27. ***AI's Impact on IT Jobs: <br>According to a report, 92% of IT jobs will undergo transformation due to AI, with mid- and low-level positions being most affected. The report stresses the growing importance of skills like AI literacy and rapid engineering, as traditional roles like data management and basic programming become less relevant.***<br>

    Aug 12, according to [cio.com](https://www.cio.com/article/3485322/92-of-it-jobs-will-be-transformed-by-ai.html), 92% of IT jobs will be transformed by AI, and the biggest change will be experienced by mid- and low-level positions, as manual tasks become less relevant or easily replaceable by this technology. To get a better idea how AI will change the labor market for technology professionals, the recently formed AI-Enabled ICT Workforce Consortium has published its inaugural report, “The Transformational Opportunity of AI on ICT Jobs,” which reveals that 92% of IT jobs will see a high or moderate transformation due to advances in AI. The study argues that the biggest changes will be seen in mid-level (40%) and entry-level (37%) technology jobs, as certain skills and capabilities become more or less relevant. AI ethics, responsible AI, rapid engineering, AI literacy, and large language model (LLM) architecture are expected to rise in importance in this new era, while traditional data management, content creation, documentation maintenance, basic programming and languages, and research information will become less relevant. That’s why, the report says, critical skills are needed in all IT jobs, including AI literacy, data analytics, and rapid engineering. That’s why the consortium is seeking to empower workers to reskill and upskill.<br><br>

29. ***Meta's UniBench for Vision-Language Models: <br>Meta introduced UniBench, a unified benchmark for evaluating vision-language models across 50+ tasks. The study reveals that while scaling models improves some capabilities, it falls short in areas like reasoning and counting, suggesting that more targeted interventions are needed for VLM progress.***<br>

    Aug 9, Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04810) “UniBench: Visual Reasoning Requires Rethinking Vision-Language Beyond Scaling”. Significant research efforts have been made to scale and improve vision-language model (VLM) training approaches. Yet, with an ever-growing number of benchmarks, researchers are tasked with the heavy burden of implementing each protocol, bearing a non-trivial computational cost, and making sense of how all these benchmarks translate into meaningful axes of progress. To facilitate a systematic evaluation of VLM progress, the authors introduce UniBench: a unified implementation of 50+ VLM benchmarks spanning a comprehensive range of carefully categorized capabilities from object recognition to spatial awareness, counting, and much more. The authors showcase the utility of UniBench for measuring progress by evaluating nearly 60 publicly available vision-language models, trained on scales of up to 12.8B samples. While scaling training data or model size can boost many vision-language model capabilities, scaling offers little benefit for reasoning or relations. Surprisingly, the authors also discover today's best VLMs struggle on simple digit recognition and counting tasks, e.g. MNIST, which much simpler networks can solve. Where scale falls short, the work finds that more precise interventions, such as data quality or tailored-learning objectives offer more promise. For practitioners, the authors also offer guidance on selecting a suitable VLM for a given application. Finally, the authors release an easy-to-run UniBench [code-base](https://github.com/facebookresearch/unibench) with the full set of 50+ benchmarks and comparisons across 59 models as well as a distilled, representative set of benchmarks that runs in 5 minutes on a single GPU.<br><br>

31. ***Elon Musk vs. OpenAI Lawsuit: <br>Elon Musk filed a new lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, accusing them of betraying the company's original non-profit mission. The lawsuit alleges manipulation and violation of agreements, highlighting the deteriorating relationship between Musk and Altman since the founding of OpenAI in 2015.***<br>

    Aug 6, according to [theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/05/elon-musk-openai-lawsuit?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email), Elon Musk has filed a new lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, alleging they manipulated him into co-founding the company and betrayed its original non-profit mission by turning it into a for-profit entity. This lawsuit follows a similar one Musk filed earlier this year but later withdrew. Musk's complaint accuses Altman and other co-founders of deceiving him and violating the "founding agreement" meant to prioritize the betterment of humanity. OpenAI denies the allegations, arguing that Musk supported the shift to a for-profit model and is motivated by jealousy. The new lawsuit also includes accusations of federal racketeering and wire fraud against Altman and his associates. The legal battle underscores the deteriorating relationship between Musk and Altman, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015 but later parted ways due to an internal power struggle. Musk has since founded his own AI company, xAI, which has struggled to match the success of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.<br><br>

33. ***The Consistent Reasoning Paradox (CRP): <br>Researchers introduced the Consistent Reasoning Paradox (CRP), which suggests that consistent reasoning, a core component of human intelligence, implies fallibility. The paradox asserts that an AI striving to mimic human intelligence through consistent reasoning will inevitably produce incorrect but plausible answers, especially in basic arithmetic. This paradox reveals that a trustworthy AI, which reasons consistently and never answers incorrectly, must be capable of acknowledging uncertainty by saying "I don't know.", a function, which current AI lacks.***<br>

    Aug 5, King’s College London, Uni of Cambridge and Simon Fraser Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02357) “On the consistent reasoning paradox of intelligence and optimal trust in AI: The power of 'I don't know'”. The paper introduces the Consistent Reasoning Paradox (CRP). Consistent reasoning, which lies at the core of human intelligence, is the ability to handle tasks that are equivalent, yet described by different sentences ('Tell me the time!' and 'What is the time?'). The CRP asserts that consistent reasoning implies fallibility -- in particular, human-like intelligence in AI necessarily comes with human-like fallibility. Specifically, it states that there are problems, e.g. in basic arithmetic, where any AI that always answers and strives to mimic human intelligence by reasoning consistently will hallucinate (produce wrong, yet plausible answers) infinitely often. The paradox is that there exists a non-consistently reasoning AI (which therefore cannot be on the level of human intelligence) that will be correct on the same set of problems. The CRP also shows that detecting these hallucinations, even in a probabilistic sense, is strictly harder than solving the original problems, and that there are problems that an AI may answer correctly, but it cannot provide a correct logical explanation for how it arrived at the answer. Therefore, the CRP implies that any trustworthy AI (i.e., an AI that never answers incorrectly) that also reasons consistently must be able to say 'I don't know'. Moreover, this can only be done by implicitly computing a new concept that the paper introduces, termed the 'I don't know' function -- something currently lacking in modern AI. In view of these insights, the CRP also provides a glimpse into the behaviour of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). An AGI cannot be 'almost sure', nor can it always explain itself, and therefore to be trustworthy it must be able to say 'I don't know'.<br><br>

35. ***McKinsey's "Technology Trends Outlook 2024": <br>McKinsey's The report identifies five key tech trends: the AI revolution, digital future building, compute and connectivity frontiers, cutting-edge engineering, and sustainability. Generative AI (Gen AI) is highlighted as a rapidly advancing area, with significant organizational adoption and the potential to generate up to $4.4 trillion in annual value. The report underscores the importance of addressing risks such as bias, misinformation, and deepfakes as organizations invest in the capabilities required to scale Gen AI, leading to a heightened demand for talent in data science, software engineering, and data engineering.***<br>

    Jul 30, [McKinsey published](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-top-trends-in-tech#/) “Technology Trends Outlook 2024”. The five tech trends categories are: the AI revolution, building the digital future, compute and connectivity frontiers, cutting-edge engineering, and a sustainable world. With regarding to GenAI, the report indicates that Generative AI (gen AI) has been making significant strides, pushing the boundaries of machine capabilities. Gen AI has sparked widespread interest, with individuals and organizations across different regions and industries exploring its potential. According to the latest McKinsey Global Survey on the state of AI, 65 percent of respondents say their organizations are regularly using gen AI in at least one business function, up from one-third last year, and gen AI use cases have the potential to generate an annual value of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion. However, it’s important to recognize the risks that accompany the use of this powerful technology, including bias, misinformation, and deepfakes. Progressing through 2024 and beyond, McKinsey anticipates organizations investing in the risk mitigation, operating model, talent, and technological capabilities required to scale gen AI. Organizations are now focusing on scaling and expanding their internal capabilities to harness the potential of gen AI, leading to a sharp increase in demand for data scientists, software engineers, and data engineers.<br><br>

37. ***Impact of Output Length on LLM Reasoning: <br>The study highlights the trade-off between generating detailed reasoning in outputs and the time required. The researcher proposes Constrained-CoT (CCoT), a refined prompt engineering strategy that limits output length while maintaining accuracy. Experiments showed that applying CCoT to LLaMA2-70b improved accuracy and reduced output length, demonstrating the effectiveness of concise reasoning in LLMs.***<br>

    Jul 29, researcher from Italy published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19825) “Concise Thoughts: Impact of Output Length on LLM Reasoning and Cost”. Today's large language models (LLMs) can solve challenging question-answering tasks, and prompt engineering techniques, such as chain-of-thought (CoT), have gained attention for enhancing the explanation and correctness of outputs. Nevertheless, models require significant time to generate answers augmented with lengthy reasoning details. To address this issue, this paper analyzes the impact of output lengths on LLM inference pipelines and proposes novel metrics to evaluate them in terms of correct conciseness. It also examines the impact of controlling output length through a refined prompt engineering strategy, Constrained-CoT (CCoT), which encourages the model to limit output length. Experiments on pre-trained LLMs demonstrated the benefit of the proposed metrics and the effectiveness of CCoT across different models. For instance, constraining the reasoning of LLaMA2-70b to 100 words improves the accuracy from 36.01% (CoT) to 41.07% (CCoT) on the GSM8K dataset, while reducing the average output length by 28 words.<br><br>

1. ***Meta's Self-Taught Evaluators: <br>
   Meta introduced a novel approach to model evaluation called "Self-Taught Evaluators," which uses synthetic training data to improve models without human annotations. This method iteratively generates and judges model outputs, significantly enhancing a large language model (LLM) without relying on costly and quickly outdated human preference data. The results show that the Self-Taught Evaluator can outperform commonly used judges and match the performance of top models trained with labeled data.*** <br><br>
   Aug 10, Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02666) “Self-Taught Evaluators”. Model-based evaluation is at the heart of successful model development -- as a reward model for training, and as a replacement for human evaluation. To train such evaluators, the standard approach is to collect a large amount of human preference judgments over model responses, which is costly and the data becomes stale as models improve. This paper presents an approach that aims to improve evaluators without human annotations, using synthetic training data only. Starting from unlabeled instructions, the iterative self-improvement scheme generates contrasting model outputs and trains an LLM-as-a-Judge to produce reasoning traces and final judgments, repeating this training at each new iteration using the improved predictions. Without any labeled preference data, the Self-Taught Evaluator can improve a strong LLM (Llama3-70B-Instruct) from 75.4 to 88.3 (88.7 with majority vote) on RewardBench. This outperforms commonly used LLM judges such as GPT-4 and matches the performance of the top-performing reward models trained with labeled examples. <br><br>

   Aug 9, cio.com published [an article](https://www.cio.com/article/3478850/four-generative-ai-use-cases-for-businesses.html) “Four generative AI use cases for businesses”. The article outlines four key use cases where generative AI is transforming business operations: 1) Virtual Assistants: Generative AI powers tools like chatbots and virtual assistants, enhancing both employee productivity and customer experiences by automating tasks and providing personalized interactions. 2) Intelligent Search: Leveraging large language models (LLMs), generative AI enables enterprises to process and search proprietary data more effectively, offering precise and relevant information tailored to business-specific needs. 3) Content Summarization: AI models can quickly summarize documents, meetings, and videos, saving time and improving decision-making in sectors like healthcare and finance. 4) Document Processing: Generative AI streamlines document management by automating tasks such as translation, proofreading, and data extraction, particularly benefiting industries that handle large volumes of documents, like legal and financial sectors. Overall, generative AI boosts productivity, reduces costs, and provides businesses with a competitive edge by enabling more efficient data processing and customer interaction. <br><br>

5. ***OpenAI Leadership Changes:  <br>Futurism reported significant leadership changes at OpenAI, with key figures like co-founder John Schulman and VP Peter Deng leaving the company. This has sparked speculation about OpenAI's ability to achieve its goal of safe artificial general intelligence (AGI). Critics suggest that these departures may indicate challenges in fulfilling its vision, with some even predicting a potential "Generative AI bubble" burst.*** <br><br>
   Aug 8, Futurism published [an article](https://futurism.com/openai-prominent-employees-leaving) “Why Are OpenAI's Most Prominent Employees Leaving?”. Cofounder John Schulman announced he'd left the company this week to join rival AI company Anthropic, while president Greg Brockman is taking a leave of absence. VP of consumer product Peter Deng has also quit, indicating major shifts in OpenAI's upper ranks. The Sam Altman-led company has made its core mission to realize safe artificial general intelligence, the still entirely hypothetical point at which point AI can keep up with humans across a wide variety of intellectual tasks. But how far the company is from doing just that remains a heavily debated subject, with critics pointing out that OpenAI is shoring up billions of dollars in investment by making empty promises — an "AI bubble" that may be set to burst. Could the latest departures show that the venture is struggling to fulfill its long-term vision, let alone turn a profit from generative AI? Critics say OpenAI's brain drain problem could be the canary in the coal mine. "Calling it," leading AI skeptic Gary Marcus tweeted. "August 2024 will be known as the month in which the Generative AI bubble burst." Other critics questioned OpenAI's repeated claims that AGI is right around the corner. "If OpenAI is right on the verge of AGI, why do prominent people keep leaving?" AI developer Benjamin de Kraker tweeted. <br><br>
 
7. ***LLM-DetectAIve for Machine-Generated Text Detection:  <br>A new tool called "LLM-DetectAIve" was introduced for detecting machine-generated texts (MGTs). Unlike previous binary classifiers, it categorizes texts into four distinct types, offering fine-grained detection. This tool is particularly valuable in academic and educational settings, where identifying the degree of LLM involvement in text creation is crucial.*** <br><br>
   Aug 8, MBZUAI, Uni of Florida, NYU, et al. published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04284) “LLM-DetectAIve: a Tool for Fine-Grained Machine-Generated Text Detection”. The widespread accessibility of large language models (LLMs) to the general public has significantly amplified the dissemination of machine-generated texts (MGTs). Advancements in prompt manipulation have exacerbated the difficulty in discerning the origin of a text (human-authored vs machinegenerated). This raises concerns regarding the potential misuse of MGTs, particularly within educational and academic domains. This paper presents LLM-DetectAIve -- a system designed for fine-grained MGT detection. It is able to classify texts into four categories: human-written, machine-generated, machine-written machine-humanized, and human-written machine-polished. Contrary to previous MGT detectors that perform binary classification, introducing two additional categories in LLM-DetectiAIve offers insights into the varying degrees of LLM intervention during the text creation. This might be useful in some domains like education, where any LLM intervention is usually prohibited. Experiments show that LLM-DetectAIve can effectively identify the authorship of textual content, proving its usefulness in enhancing integrity in education, academia, and other domains.

FFM learning allows most machine learning operations to be conducted efficiently on physical systems rather than digital simulations, leading to faster learning processes and significant advancements in deep learning, ultrasensitive perception, and topological photonics.*** <br><br>
    Aug 7, Nature published a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07687-4.pdf) “Fully forward mode training for optical neural networks”. Optical computing promises to improve the speed and energy efficiency of machine learning applications. However, current approaches to efficiently train these models are limited by in silico emulation on digital computers. This research develops a method called fully forward mode (FFM) learning, which implements the compute-intensive training process on the physical system. The majority of the machine learning operations are thus efficiently conducted in parallel on site, alleviating numerical modelling constraints. In free-space and integrated photonics, the researchers experimentally demonstrate optical systems with state-of-the-art performances for a given network size. FFM learning shows training the deepest optical neural networks with millions of parameters achieves accuracy equivalent to the ideal model. It supports all-optical focusing through scattering media with a resolution of the diffraction limit; it can also image in parallel the objects hidden outside the direct line of sight at over a kilohertz frame rate and can conduct all-optical processing with light intensity as weak as subphoton per pixel (5.40 × 1018- operations-per-second-per-watt energy efficiency) at room temperature. Furthermore, the study proves that FFM learning can automatically search non-Hermitian exceptional points without an analytical model. FFM learning not only facilitates orders-of-magnitude-faster learning processes, but can also advance applied and theoretical fields such as deep neural networks, ultrasensitive perception and topological photonics. <br><br>

11. ***Human-Level Robot Table Tennis:  <br>Google researchers developed a robot that achieved amateur human-level performance in competitive table tennis. The robot uses a hierarchical policy architecture and zero-shot sim-to-real techniques to adapt to new opponents in real time. It performed well against beginners and intermediate players, showcasing significant progress toward human-level robotic performance in physical tasks.*** <br><br>
    Aug 7, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03906) “Achieving Human Level Competitive Robot Table Tennis”. Achieving human-level speed and performance on real world tasks is a north star for the robotics research community. This work takes a step towards that goal and presents the first learned robot agent that reaches amateur human-level performance in competitive table tennis. Table tennis is a physically demanding sport which requires human players to undergo years of training to achieve an advanced level of proficiency. The paper contributes (1) a hierarchical and modular policy architecture consisting of (i) low level controllers with their detailed skill descriptors which model the agent's capabilities and help to bridge the sim-to-real gap and (ii) a high level controller that chooses the low level skills, (2) techniques for enabling zero-shot sim-to-real including an iterative approach to defining the task distribution that is grounded in the real-world and defines an automatic curriculum, and (3) real time adaptation to unseen opponents. Policy performance was assessed through 29 robot vs. human matches of which the robot won 45% (13/29). All humans were unseen players and their skill level varied from beginner to tournament level. Whilst the robot lost all matches vs. the most advanced players it won 100% matches vs. beginners and 55% matches vs. intermediate players, demonstrating solidly amateur human-level performance. Videos of the matches can be viewed at https://sites.google.com/view/competitive-robot-table-tennis <br><br>

15. ***CoverBench for Complex Claim Verification:  <br>Google and Tel Aviv University released "CoverBench," a benchmark for verifying the correctness of language models' outputs in complex reasoning tasks. It provides a diversified evaluation for complex claim verification across various domains, ensuring high data quality and challenging baseline results. The benchmark aims to advance the accuracy and reliability of language models in handling complex queries.*** <br><br>
    Aug 6, Google and Tel Aviv Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03325) “CoverBench: A Challenging Benchmark for Complex Claim Verification”. There is a growing line of research on verifying the correctness of language models' outputs. At the same time, LMs are being used to tackle complex queries that require reasoning. The paper introduces CoverBench, a challenging benchmark focused on verifying LM outputs in complex reasoning settings. Datasets that can be used for this purpose are often designed for other complex reasoning tasks (e.g., QA) targeting specific use-cases (e.g., financial tables), requiring transformations, negative sampling and selection of hard examples to collect such a benchmark. CoverBench provides a diversified evaluation for complex claim verification in a variety of domains, types of reasoning, relatively long inputs, and a variety of standardizations, such as multiple representations for tables where available, and a consistent schema. The authors manually vet the data for quality to ensure low levels of label noise. Finally, the paper reports a variety of competitive baseline results to show CoverBench is challenging and has very significant headroom. The data is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/google/coverbench. <br><br>

17. ***Scaling LLM Test-Time Compute:  <br>A joint study by UC Berkeley and Google explored the effectiveness of scaling test-time computation for large language models (LLMs). The research suggests that optimizing test-time compute allocation can significantly enhance LLM performance, potentially outperforming models with more parameters. This approach may lead to more efficient and self-improving AI agents.*** <br><br>
    Aug 6, UC Berkeley and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03314) “Scaling LLM Test-Time Compute Optimally can be More Effective than Scaling Model Parameters”. Enabling LLMs to improve their outputs by using more test-time computation is a critical step towards building generally self-improving agents that can operate on open-ended natural language. The paper studies the scaling of inference-time computation in LLMs, with a focus on answering the question: if an LLM is allowed to use a fixed but non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much can it improve its performance on a challenging prompt? Answering this question has implications not only on the achievable performance of LLMs, but also on the future of LLM pretraining and how one should tradeoff inference-time and pre-training compute. Despite its importance, little research attempted to understand the scaling behaviors of various test-time inference methods. Moreover, current work largely provides negative results for a number of these strategies. This study analyzes two primary mechanisms to scale test-time computation: (1) searching against dense, process-based verifier reward models; and (2) updating the model's distribution over a response adaptively, given the prompt at test time. The authors find that in both cases, the effectiveness of different approaches to scaling test-time compute critically varies depending on the difficulty of the prompt. This observation motivates applying a "compute-optimal" scaling strategy, which acts to most effectively allocate test-time compute adaptively per prompt. Using this compute-optimal strategy will improve the efficiency of test-time compute scaling by more than 4x compared to a best-of-N baseline. Additionally, in a FLOPs-matched evaluation, it is found that on problems where a smaller base model attains somewhat non-trivial success rates, test-time compute can be used to outperform a 14x larger model. <br><br>

19. ***Google's Antitrust Ruling:  <br>A US judge ruled that Google illegally maintained its monopoly on online search and advertising by paying billions to be the default search engine on smartphones and browsers. This landmark decision could have significant implications for how tech giants operate, as antitrust authorities aim to strengthen competition. The penalties Google may face will be decided in a future hearing.*** <br><br>
    Aug 6, [according to BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0k44x6mge3o), A US judge has ruled Google acted illegally to crush its competition and maintain a monopoly on online search and related advertising. The landmark decision on Monday is a major blow to Alphabet, Google's parent company, and could reshape how technology giants do business. Google was sued by the US Department of Justice in 2020 over its control of about 90% of the online search market. It is one of several lawsuits that have been filed against the big tech companies as US antitrust authorities attempt to strengthen competition in the industry. This case has at times been described as posing an existential threat to Google and its owner given its dominance of the search and online advertising business. It is unclear yet what penalties Google and Alphabet will face as a result of the decision. The fines or other remedies will be decided in a future hearing. In his decision, US District Judge Amit Mehta said Google had paid billions to ensure it is the default search engine on smartphones and browsers. “Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,” Judge Mehta wrote in his 277-page opinion. Alphabet said it plans to appeal against the ruling. US Attorney General Merrick Garland, the country's top prosecutor, hailed the ruling as a "historic win for the American people". Another case against the technology company over its advertising technology is scheduled to go to trial in September. In Europe, meanwhile, Google has been fined billions in monopoly cases. <br><br>

21. ***Privacy in AI Assistants:  <br>Google proposed operationalizing contextual integrity (CI) in AI assistants to address privacy concerns. By aligning information-sharing actions with privacy expectations, the framework aims to prevent AI assistants from inappropriately sharing user information. The study's evaluation shows that CI-based reasoning improves privacy compliance in AI assistants.*** <br><br>
    Aug 5, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02373) “Operationalizing Contextual Integrity in Privacy-Conscious Assistants”. Advanced AI assistants combine frontier LLMs and tool access to autonomously perform complex tasks on behalf of users. While the helpfulness of such assistants can increase dramatically with access to user information including emails and documents, this raises privacy concerns about assistants sharing inappropriate information with third parties without user supervision. To steer information-sharing assistants to behave in accordance with privacy expectations, the study proposes to operationalize contextual integrity (CI), a framework that equates privacy with the appropriate flow of information in a given context. In particular, the authors design and evaluate a number of strategies to steer assistants' information-sharing actions to be CI compliant. The evaluation is based on a novel form filling benchmark composed of synthetic data and human annotations, and it reveals that prompting frontier LLMs to perform CI-based reasoning yields strong results. <br><br>

23. ***RAG Foundry Framework:  <br>Intel Labs introduced "RAG Foundry," an open-source framework for enhancing large language models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The framework integrates data creation, training, inference, and evaluation, allowing for rapid prototyping and experimentation with RAG techniques. RAG Foundry has shown consistent improvements in knowledge-intensive tasks.*** <br><br>
    Aug 5, Inter Labs published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02545) “RAG Foundry: A Framework for Enhancing LLMs for Retrieval Augmented Generation”. Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems is inherently complex, requiring deep understanding of data, use cases, and intricate design decisions. Additionally, evaluating these systems presents significant challenges, necessitating assessment of both retrieval accuracy and generative quality through a multi-faceted approach. The paper introduces RAG Foundry, an open-source framework for augmenting large language models for RAG use cases. RAG Foundry integrates data creation, training, inference and evaluation into a single workflow, facilitating the creation of data-augmented datasets for training and evaluating large language models in RAG settings. This integration enables rapid prototyping and experimentation with various RAG techniques, allowing users to easily generate datasets and train RAG models using internal or specialized knowledge sources. The paper demonstrates the framework's effectiveness by augmenting and fine-tuning Llama-3 and Phi-3 models with diverse RAG configurations, showcasing consistent improvements across three knowledge-intensive datasets. Code is released as open-source in https://github.com/IntelLabs/RAGFoundry.  <br><br>

25. ***Jailbreaking LLMs:  <br>NYU and Meta published a study analyzing the jailbreaking of large language models (LLMs) from a statistical perspective. The research introduces E-RLHF, a modification to the existing RLHF objective, which increases the likelihood of safe responses. E-RLHF outperforms RLHF in preventing harmful behavior while maintaining model performance.*** <br><br>
    Aug 2, NYU and Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01420) “Mission Impossible: A Statistical Perspective on Jailbreaking LLMs”. Large language models (LLMs) are trained on a deluge of text data with limited quality control. As a result, LLMs can exhibit unintended or even harmful behaviours, such as leaking information, fake news or hate speech. Countermeasures, commonly referred to as preference alignment, include fine-tuning the pretrained LLMs with carefully crafted text examples of desired behaviour. Even then, empirical evidence shows preference aligned LLMs can be enticed to harmful behaviour. This so called jailbreaking of LLMs is typically achieved by adversarially modifying the input prompt to the LLM. The paper provides theoretical insights into the phenomenon of preference alignment and jailbreaking from a statistical perspective. Under the framework, the authors first show that pretrained LLMs will mimic harmful behaviour if present in the training corpus. Under that same framework, the paper then introduces a statistical notion of alignment, and lower-bound the jailbreaking probability, showing that it is unpreventable under reasonable assumptions. Based on the insights, the authors propose an alteration to the currently prevalent alignment strategy RLHF. Specifically, the research introduces a simple modification to the RLHF objective, called E-RLHF, that aims to increase the likelihood of safe responses. E-RLHF brings no additional training cost, and is compatible with other methods. Empirically, the study demonstrates that E-RLHF outperforms RLHF on all alignment problems put forward by the AdvBench and HarmBench project without sacrificing model performance as measured by the MT-Bench project. <br><br>

27. ***RELBENCH for Relational Databases:  <br>Stanford University and Kumo.AI introduced "RELBENCH," a benchmark for predictive tasks over relational databases using graph neural networks. The study demonstrates that relational deep learning (RDL) models outperform traditional manual feature engineering, reducing human effort and improving predictive accuracy.*** <br><br>
    Jul 29, Stanford Uni, Kumo.AI etc published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20060) “RELBENCH: A Benchmark for Deep Learning on Relational Databases”.  The paper presents RELBENCH, a public benchmark for solving predictive tasks over relational databases with graph neural networks. RELBENCH provides databases and tasks spanning diverse domains and scales, and is intended to be a foundational infrastructure for future research. The work uses RELBENCH to conduct the first comprehensive study of Relational Deep Learning (RDL) (Fey et al., 2024), which combines graph neural network predictive models with (deep) tabular models that extract initial entity-level representations from raw tables. End-to-end learned RDL models fully exploit the predictive signal encoded in primary-foreign key links, marking a significant shift away from the dominant paradigm of manual feature engineering combined with tabular models. To thoroughly evaluate RDL against this prior gold-standard, the authors conduct an in-depth user study where an experienced data scientist manually engineers features for each task. In this study, RDL learns better models whilst reducing human work needed by more than an order of magnitude. This demonstrates the power of deep learning for solving predictive tasks over relational databases, opening up many new research opportunities enabled by RelBench. <br><br>

29. ***Chain of Code for Reasoning:  <br>A paper from Google, Stanford, and UC Berkeley proposed "Chain of Code" (CoC), an extension to improve language model reasoning by integrating code emulation. CoC outperforms existing reasoning methods like Chain of Thought, broadening the scope of questions LMs can answer by simulating code execution.*** <br><br>
    Jul 29, Google, Stanford Uni, and UC Berkley published a [paper](https://chain-of-code.github.io/paper.pdf) on ICML2024 “Chain of Code: Reasoning with a Language Model-Augmented Code Emulator”. Code provides a general syntactic structure to build complex programs and perform precise computations when paired with a code interpreter – it’s hypothesized that language models (LMs) can leverage code-writing to improve Chain of Thought reasoning not only for logic and arithmetic tasks, but also for semantic ones (and in particular, those that are a mix of both). For example, consider prompting an LM to write code that counts the number of times it detects sarcasm in an essay: the LM may struggle to write an implementation for "detect_sarcasm(string)" that can be executed by the interpreter (handling the edge cases would be insurmountable). However, LMs may still produce a valid solution if they not only write code, but also selectively "emulate" the interpreter by generating the expected output of "detect_sarcasm(string)". This paper proposes Chain of Code (CoC), a simple yet surprisingly effective extension that improves LM code-driven reasoning. The key idea is to encourage LMs to format semantic sub-tasks in a program as flexible pseudocode that the interpreter can explicitly catch undefined behaviors and hand off to simulate with an LM (as an "LMulator"). Experiments demonstrate that Chain of Code outperforms Chain of Thought and other baselines across a variety of benchmarks; on BIG-Bench Hard, Chain of Code achieves 84%, a gain of 12% over Chain of Thought. In a nutshell, CoC broadens the scope of reasoning questions that LMs can answer by "thinking in code". <br><br>

30. ***AdaCoder for Visual Question Answering:  <br>Researchers from Tokyo Institute of Technology and OMRON SINIC X Corp developed "AdaCoder," a framework for adaptive prompt compression in visual programmatic models (VPMs). AdaCoder reduces input token length while maintaining or improving performance in visual question answering tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing VPMs.*** <br><br>
    Jul 28, Tokyo Inst. Of Tech, OMRON SINIC X Corp et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19410) “AdaCoder: Adaptive Prompt Compression for Programmatic Visual Question Answering”. Visual question answering aims to provide responses to natural language questions given visual input. Recently, visual programmatic models (VPMs), which generate executable programs to answer questions through large language models (LLMs), have attracted research interest. However, they often require long input prompts to provide the LLM with sufficient API usage details to generate relevant code. To address this limitation, the paper proposes AdaCoder, an adaptive prompt compression framework for VPMs. AdaCoder operates in two phases: a compression phase and an inference phase. In the compression phase, given a preprompt that describes all API definitions in the Python language with example snippets of code, a set of compressed preprompts is generated, each depending on a specific question type. In the inference phase, given an input question, AdaCoder predicts the question type and chooses the appropriate corresponding compressed preprompt to generate code to answer the question. Notably, AdaCoder employs a single frozen LLM and pre-defined prompts, negating the necessity of additional training and maintaining adaptability across different powerful black-box LLMs such as GPT and Claude. In experiments, the authors apply AdaCoder to ViperGPT and demonstrate that it reduces token length by 71.1%, while maintaining or even improving the performance of visual question answering. <br><br>

32. ***Modular RAG Framework:  <br>A modular framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems is proposed to enable highly reconfigurable and specialized operators. This framework addresses the limitations of existing RAG paradigms, facilitating the development of more efficient and adaptable RAG systems.*** <br><br>
    Jul 26, Tonji Uni and Fudan Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21059) “Modular RAG: Transforming RAG Systems into LEGO-like Reconfigurable Frameworks”. Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has markedly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. The increasing demands of application scenarios have driven the evolution of RAG, leading to the integration of advanced retrievers, LLMs and other complementary technologies, which in turn has amplified the intricacy of RAG systems. However, the rapid advancements are outpacing the foundational RAG paradigm, with many methods struggling to be unified under the process of "retrieve-then-generate". In this context, this paper examines the limitations of the existing RAG paradigm and introduces the modular RAG framework. By decomposing complex RAG systems into independent modules and specialized operators, it facilitates a highly reconfigurable framework. Modular RAG transcends the traditional linear architecture, embracing a more advanced design that integrates routing, scheduling, and fusion mechanisms. Drawing on extensive research, this paper further identifies prevalent RAG patterns-linear, conditional, branching, and looping-and offers a comprehensive analysis of their respective implementation nuances. Modular RAG presents innovative opportunities for the conceptualization and deployment of RAG systems. Finally, the paper explores the potential emergence of new operators and paradigms, establishing a solid theoretical foundation and a practical roadmap for the continued evolution and practical deployment of RAG technologies. <br><br>

34. ***Limitations of Instruction Tuning:  <br>the ICML2024 paper finds that while IT is widely used to convert pre-trained LLMs into conversational agents, it doesn't improve knowledge or skills and may even degrade them. Key issues include a decline in response quality, increased hallucination, and the ineffectiveness of popular IT improvement methods. The authors emphasize that responses based on pre-trained knowledge outperform those generated from IT and hope these insights guide future research.*** <br><br>
    Jul 14, Uni of Maryland, Adobe, and Nvidia published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05119) on ICML2024 “A Closer Look at the Limitations of Instruction Tuning”. Instruction Tuning (IT), the process of training large language models (LLMs) using instruction-response pairs, has emerged as the predominant method for transforming base pre-trained LLMs into open-domain conversational agents. While IT has achieved notable success and widespread adoption, its limitations and shortcomings remain underexplored. In this paper, through rigorous experiments and an in-depth analysis of the changes LLMs undergo through IT, the authors reveal various limitations of IT. In particular, the research shows that (1) IT fails to enhance knowledge or skills in LLMs. LoRA fine-tuning is limited to learning response initiation and style tokens, and full-parameter fine-tuning leads to knowledge degradation. (2) Copying response patterns from IT datasets derived from knowledgeable sources leads to a decline in response quality. (3) Full-parameter fine-tuning increases hallucination by inaccurately borrowing tokens from conceptually similar instances in the IT dataset for generating responses. (4) Popular methods to improve IT do not lead to performance improvements over a simple LoRA fine-tuned model. The findings reveal that responses generated solely from pre-trained knowledge consistently outperform responses by models that learn any form of new knowledge from IT on open-source datasets. The authors hope the insights and challenges revealed in this paper inspire future work in related directions.

1. ***Lean AI and Small Language Models: <br>
   The article discusses the shift towards lean AI, which aims to optimize efficiency and minimize resource consumption. This shift is driven by the high costs and resource demands of large language models (LLMs). Small language models (SLMs) are becoming more popular due to their lower operational costs, faster deployment cycles, and specialized applications.

3. ***Meta's SAM 2 for Visual Segmentation: <br>
   Meta introduced the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) for visual segmentation in images and videos. SAM 2 uses a transformer architecture with streaming memory for real-time video processing and has the largest video segmentation dataset. It provides better accuracy with fewer interactions and is significantly faster and more accurate than its predecessor, SAM. The model, dataset, and an interactive demo are being released.***
   
   Aug 1, Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00714) “SAM 2: Segment Anything in Images and Videos”. The research presents Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), a foundation model towards solving promptable visual segmentation in images and videos. The  authors build a data engine, which improves model and data via user interaction, to collect the largest video segmentation dataset to date. The model is a simple transformer architecture with streaming memory for real-time video processing. SAM 2 trained on the data provides strong performance across a wide range of tasks. In video segmentation, it is observed better accuracy, using 3x fewer interactions than prior approaches. In image segmentation, the model is more accurate and 6x faster than the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The authors believe that the data, model, and insights will serve as a significant milestone for video segmentation and related perception tasks.

5. ***Microsoft's OmniParser for GUI Agents: <br>
   Microsoft presented OmniParser, a method for parsing user interface screenshots into structured elements. OmniParser enhances GPT-4V's ability to generate actions accurately grounded in the corresponding regions of the interface. By using curated datasets for icon detection and description, OmniParser significantly improves performance on benchmarks and outperforms existing models that require additional information.***
   Aug 1, Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00203) “OmniParser for Pure Vision Based GUI Agent”. The recent success of large vision language models shows great potential in driving the agent system operating on user interfaces. However, the power multimodal models like GPT-4V as a general agent on multiple operating systems across different applications is largely underestimated due to the lack of a robust screen parsing technique capable of: 1) reliably identifying interactable icons within the user interface, and 2) understanding the semantics of various elements in a screenshot and accurately associate the intended action with the corresponding region on the screen. To fill these gaps, the paper introduces OmniParser, a comprehensive method for parsing user interface screenshots into structured elements, which significantly enhances the ability of GPT-4V to generate actions that can be accurately grounded in the corresponding regions of the interface. The authors first curated an interactable icon detection dataset using popular webpages and an icon description dataset. These datasets were utilized to fine-tune specialized models: a detection model to parse interactable regions on the screen and a caption model to extract the functional semantics of the detected elements. OmniParser significantly improves GPT-4V's performance on ScreenSpot benchmark. And on Mind2Web and AITW benchmark, OmniParser with screenshot only input outperforms the GPT-4V baselines requiring additional information outside of screenshot. <br><br>

8. ***Scaling Inference Compute with Repeated Sampling: <br>
   Researchers from Stanford, Oxford, and Google explored scaling inference compute by increasing the number of generated samples. They found that coverage, or the fraction of problems solved, scales with the number of samples. Repeated sampling significantly improves performance in domains with verifiable answers, and it is cost-effective. However, identifying correct samples in domains without automatic verifiers remains a challenge.***
   
   Jul 31, Stanford Uni, Uni of Oxford and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21787) “Large Language Monkeys: Scaling Inference Compute with Repeated Sampling”. Scaling the amount of compute used to train language models has dramatically improved their capabilities. However, when it comes to inference, we often limit the amount of compute to only one attempt per problem. This paper explores inference compute as another axis for scaling by increasing the number of generated samples. Across multiple tasks and models, the authors observe that coverage - the fraction of problems solved by any attempt - scales with the number of samples over four orders of magnitude. In domains like coding and formal proofs, where all answers can be automatically verified, these increases in coverage directly translate into improved performance. When applying repeated sampling to SWE-bench Lite, the fraction of issues solved with DeepSeek-V2-Coder-Instruct increases from 15.9% with one sample to 56% with 250 samples, outperforming the single-attempt state-of-the-art of 43% which uses more capable frontier models. Moreover, using current API pricing, amplifying the cheaper DeepSeek model with five samples is more cost-effective and solves more issues than paying a premium for one sample from GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Interestingly, the relationship between coverage and the number of samples is often log-linear and can be modelled with an exponentiated power law, suggesting the existence of inference-time scaling laws. Finally, the work finds that identifying correct samples out of many generations remains an important direction for future research in domains without automatic verifiers. When solving math word problems from GSM8K and MATH, coverage with Llama-3 models grows to over 95% with 10,000 samples. However, common methods to pick correct solutions from a sample collection, such as majority voting or reward models, plateau beyond several hundred samples and fail to fully scale with the sample budget. <br><br>

9. ***Australia's Privacy Concerns with Social Media Platform X: <br>
    Australia's privacy watchdog is concerned that social media platform X (formerly Twitter) may be breaching privacy laws by automatically opting users into having their posts used to train AI systems. Platforms are required to ensure default settings enable user control and seek consent for data use. The watchdog is investigating practices across the industry as other major platforms also harvest user data to train AI.***
   
    Jul 31, according to [abc.new.au](https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2024-07-31/elon-musk-x-breach-privacy-law-data-harvest-grok-ai/104054400), Australia's privacy watchdog says social media platform X (formerly Twitter) may be in breach of Australian privacy law after it emerged users were automatically opted in to having their posts used to build artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner stopped short of saying it would launch an inquiry into the platform's data collection, similar to the one it is currently undertaking in relation to TikTok. On Friday, an X user pointed out the X app privacy settings includes a pre-ticked box that permits X to use the account holder's posts to train the Grok AI chatbot built by Elon Musk's company xAI. The default setting states that you "allow your posts as well as your interactions, inputs and results with Grok to be used for training and fine-tuning". Under Australian law, platforms are required to ensure default settings enable user control, and to either seek an individuals' consent for how the platform will use the data, or be satisfied the user would reasonably expect the organisation to use their data for this purpose. In recent months, it also emerged other platforms, such as Meta and Slack, were harvesting user data to train AI as part of a global race to build bigger and better large language models (LLMs). Last month, it was revealed xAI was trying to build the world's largest supercomputer in the US city of Memphis to fuel its AI ambitions. The Commissioner's Office says it's "looking at such practices across the industry" as other major platforms, also competing to build their own AIs, harvest user data. <br><br>

11. ***Safetywashing in AI Safety Benchmarks: <br>
    A study by various universities analyzed AI safety benchmarks and found many are highly correlated with general capabilities, leading to "safetywashing." The study calls for more meaningful safety metrics that are empirically separable from generic capabilities. The authors propose a rigorous framework for AI safety research to advance the science of safety evaluations and clarify measurable progress.***
    
    Jul 31, Center of AI Safety, Uni of Penn., UC Berkeley, Stanford Uni, Yale Uni and Keio Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21792) “Safetywashing: Do AI Safety Benchmarks Actually Measure Safety Progress?”. As artificial intelligence systems grow more powerful, there has been increasing interest in "AI safety" research to address emerging and future risks. However, the field of AI safety remains poorly defined and inconsistently measured, leading to confusion about how researchers can contribute. This lack of clarity is compounded by the unclear relationship between AI safety benchmarks and upstream general capabilities (e.g., general knowledge and reasoning). To address these issues, the study conducts a comprehensive meta-analysis of AI safety benchmarks, empirically analyzing their correlation with general capabilities across dozens of models and providing a survey of existing directions in AI safety. The findings reveal that many safety benchmarks highly correlate with upstream model capabilities, potentially enabling "safetywashing" -- where capability improvements are misrepresented as safety advancements. Based on these findings, the authors propose an empirical foundation for developing more meaningful safety metrics and define AI safety in a machine learning research context as a set of clearly delineated research goals that are empirically separable from generic capabilities advancements. In doing so, the authors aim to provide a more rigorous framework for AI safety research, advancing the science of safety evaluations and clarifying the path towards measurable progress. <br><br>

17. ***Meta's Self-Improving Language Models: <br>
    Meta, UC Berkeley, and NYU introduced a Meta-Rewarding step for self-improving language models. This method improves models' judgment skills by having them judge their own responses. The approach enhances both judgment and instruction-following abilities without human supervision, showing significant performance improvements on benchmarks.***
    
    Jul 30, Meta, UC Berkeley, and NYU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19594) “Meta-Rewarding Language Models: Self-Improving Alignment with LLM-as-a-Meta-Judge”. Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly surpassing human knowledge in many domains. While improving these models traditionally relies on costly human data, recent self-rewarding mechanisms (Yuan et al., 2024) have shown that LLMs can improve by judging their own responses instead of relying on human labelers. However, existing methods have primarily focused on improving model responses rather than judgment capabilities, resulting in rapid saturation during iterative training. To address this issue, the paper introduces a novel Meta-Rewarding step to the self-improvement process, where the model judges its own judgements and uses that feedback to refine its judgment skills. Surprisingly, this unsupervised approach improves the model's ability to judge {\em and} follow instructions, as demonstrated by a win rate improvement of Llama-3-8B-Instruct from 22.9% to 39.4% on AlpacaEval 2, and 20.6% to 29.1% on Arena-Hard. These results strongly suggest the potential for self-improving models without human supervision. <br><br>

19. ***Google's MoNE for Efficient Visual Processing: <br>
    Google and the University of Washington presented the Mixture of Nested Experts (MoNE) model, which uses a nested structure for experts to process visual tokens efficiently. MoNE reduces inference time compute while maintaining performance, making it adaptable to different compute budgets. The approach is validated on standard image and video datasets.***
    
    Jul 30, Google and Uni of Washington published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19985) “Mixture of Nested Experts: Adaptive Processing of Visual Tokens”. The visual medium (images and videos) naturally contains a large amount of information redundancy, thereby providing a great opportunity for leveraging efficiency in processing. While Vision Transformer (ViT) based models scale effectively to large data regimes, they fail to capitalize on this inherent redundancy, leading to higher computational costs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) networks demonstrate scalability while maintaining same inference-time costs, but they come with a larger parameter footprint. The paper presents Mixture of Nested Experts (MoNE), which utilizes a nested structure for experts, wherein individual experts fall on an increasing compute-accuracy curve. Given a compute budget, MoNE learns to dynamically choose tokens in a priority order, and thus redundant tokens are processed through cheaper nested experts. Using this framework, MoNE achieves equivalent performance as the baseline models, while reducing inference time compute by over two-fold. The authors validate the approach on standard image and video datasets - ImageNet-21K, Kinetics400, and Something-Something-v2. The authors further highlight MoNE's adaptability by showcasing its ability to maintain strong performance across different inference-time compute budgets on videos, using only a single trained model. <br><br>

21. ***Diffusion Augmented Agents for RL: <br>
    Google introduced Diffusion Augmented Agents (DAAG), a framework leveraging language models, vision language models, and diffusion models to improve sample efficiency and transfer learning in reinforcement learning. DAAG enhances learning by transforming past experiences to align with target instructions, reducing the need for reward-labeled data and improving lifelong learning capabilities.***
    
    Jul 30, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20798) “Diffusion Augmented Agents: A Framework for Efficient Exploration and Transfer Learning”. The paper introduces Diffusion Augmented Agents (DAAG), a novel framework that leverages large language models, vision language models, and diffusion models to improve sample efficiency and transfer learning in reinforcement learning for embodied agents. DAAG hindsight relabels the agent's past experience by using diffusion models to transform videos in a temporally and geometrically consistent way to align with target instructions with a technique called as Hindsight Experience Augmentation. A large language model orchestrates this autonomous process without requiring human supervision, making it well-suited for lifelong learning scenarios. The framework reduces the amount of reward-labeled data needed to 1) finetune a vision language model that acts as a reward detector, and 2) train RL agents on new tasks. The paper demonstrates the sample efficiency gains of DAAG in simulated robotics environments involving manipulation and navigation. The results show that DAAG improves learning of reward detectors, transferring past experience, and acquiring new tasks - key abilities for developing efficient lifelong learning agents.

It uses a transformer architecture with streaming memory for real-time processing and has the largest video segmentation dataset. SAM 2 provides better accuracy and speed compared to its predecessor, SAM, and is being released with a dataset and demo.***
    
    Jul 29, Meta published a [paper](https://scontent.fcbr1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/453323338_287900751050452_6064535069828837026_n.pdf?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=3c67a6&_nc_ohc=iEdf_eLLDBIQ7kNvgHvSueV&_nc_ht=scontent.fcbr1-1.fna&gid=AbMZVotuhlaDUcgiZQmipJh&oh=00_AYCMj0UJk4ZJNT-OM4nxXp6vgeWLO9SHo56ZlmA1qZHoaQ&oe=66B0FCB9) “SAM 2: Segment Anything in Images and Videos”.  The paper presents Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2 ), a foundation model towards solving promptable visual segmentation in images and videos. The authors build a data engine, which improves model and data via user interaction, to collect the largest video segmentation dataset to date. The model is a simple transformer architecture with streaming memory for real-time video processing. SAM 2 trained on the data provides strong performance across a wide range of tasks. In video segmentation, it’s observed better accuracy, using 3x fewer interactions than prior approaches. In image segmentation, the model is more accurate and 6x faster than the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The authors believe that the data, model, and insights will serve as a significant milestone for video segmentation and related perception tasks. The authors are releasing [a version of the model](https://ai.meta.com/sam2/), the dataset and an interactive demo. <br><br>

25. ***SaulLM Models for Legal Domain: <br>
    MICS and CINES introduced SaulLM-54B and SaulLM-141B, large language models tailored for the legal sector. These models are based on the Mixtral architecture and use domain adaptation strategies for legal tasks. They outperform previous models on LegalBench-Instruct and are released under the MIT License to facilitate reuse and research.***
    
    Jul 28, MICS and CINES published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19584) “SaulLM-54B & SaulLM-141B: Scaling Up Domain Adaptation for the Legal Domain”. The paper introduces SaulLM-54B and SaulLM-141B, two large language models (LLMs) tailored for the legal sector. These models, which feature architectures of 54 billion and 141 billion parameters, respectively, are based on the Mixtral architecture. The development of SaulLM-54B and SaulLM-141B is guided by large-scale domain adaptation, divided into three strategies: (1) the exploitation of continued pretraining involving a base corpus that includes over 540 billion of legal tokens, (2) the implementation of a specialized legal instruction-following protocol, and (3) the alignment of model outputs with human preferences in legal interpretations. The integration of synthetically generated data in the second and third steps enhances the models' capabilities in interpreting and processing legal texts, effectively reaching state-of-the-art performance and outperforming previous open-source models on LegalBench-Instruct. This work explores the trade-offs involved in domain-specific adaptation at this scale, offering insights that may inform future studies on domain adaptation using strong decoder models. Building upon SaulLM-7B, this study refines the approach to produce an LLM better equipped for legal tasks. The authors are releasing base, instruct, and aligned versions on top of SaulLM-54B and SaulLM-141B under the MIT License to facilitate reuse and collaborative research. <br><br>

27. ***Amazon's REAPER for RAG Systems: <br>
    Amazon presented REAPER, a reasoning-based retrieval planner for complex RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems. REAPER generates retrieval plans for conversational systems, significantly reducing latency and scaling easily to new use cases. The method is shown to improve performance in a conversational shopping assistant context.***
    
    Jul 26, Amazon published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18553) “REAPER: Reasoning based Retrieval Planning for Complex RAG Systems”. Complex dialog systems often use retrieved evidence to facilitate factual responses. Such RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems retrieve from massive heterogeneous data stores that are usually architected as multiple indexes or APIs instead of a single monolithic source. For a given query, relevant evidence needs to be retrieved from one or a small subset of possible retrieval sources. Complex queries can even require multi-step retrieval. For example, a conversational agent on a retail site answering customer questions about past orders will need to retrieve the appropriate customer order first and then the evidence relevant to the customer's question in the context of the ordered product. Most RAG Agents handle such Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks by interleaving reasoning and retrieval steps. However, each reasoning step directly adds to the latency of the system. For large models this latency cost is significant -- in the order of multiple seconds. Multi-agent systems may classify the query to a single Agent associated with a retrieval source, though this means that a (small) classification model dictates the performance of a large language model. This paper presents REAPER (REAsoning-based PlannER) - an LLM based planner to generate retrieval plans in conversational systems. The paper shows significant gains in latency over Agent-based systems and are able to scale easily to new and unseen use cases as compared to classification-based planning. Though the method can be applied to any RAG system, the authors show the results in the context of a conversational shopping assistant. <br><br>

29. ***Apple's MMAU Benchmark for LLM Agents: <br>
    Apple introduced the Massive Multitask Agent Understanding (MMAU) benchmark, evaluating models across five domains and capabilities. MMAU provides a comprehensive framework for assessing LLM agents' strengths and limitations with detailed analyses of 18 models. The benchmark enhances interpretability and understanding of model performance.***
    
    Jul 18, Apple published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18961) “MMAU: A Holistic Benchmark of Agent Capabilities Across Diverse Domains”. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have increased the demand for comprehensive benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities as human-like agents. Existing benchmarks, while useful, often focus on specific application scenarios, emphasizing task completion but failing to dissect the underlying skills that drive these outcomes. This lack of granularity makes it difficult to deeply discern where failures stem from. Additionally, setting up these environments requires considerable effort, and issues of unreliability and reproducibility sometimes arise, especially in interactive tasks. To address these limitations, the authors introduce the Massive Multitask Agent Understanding (MMAU) benchmark, featuring comprehensive offline tasks that eliminate the need for complex environment setups. It evaluates models across five domains, including Tool-use, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) QA, Data Science and Machine Learning coding, Contest-level programming and Mathematics, and covers five essential capabilities: Understanding, Reasoning, Planning, Problem-solving, and Self-correction. With a total of 20 meticulously designed tasks encompassing over 3K distinct prompts, MMAU provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the strengths and limitations of LLM agents. By testing 18 representative models on MMAU, the paper provides deep and insightful analyses. Ultimately, MMAU not only sheds light on the capabilities and limitations of LLM agents but also enhances the interpretability of their performance. Datasets and evaluation scripts of MMAU are released at https://github.com/apple/axlearn/blob/main/docs/research/mmau.

1. ***Google’s AI achieves silver-medal standard solving International Mathematical Olympiad problems <br>
Google's AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry teams developed new AI systems capable of solving complex math problems. The systems, AlphaProof for algebra and number theory, and AlphaGeometry 2 for geometry, achieved a silver-medal standard at the 2023 International Mathematical Olympiad, solving four out of six problems. AlphaProof handled algebra and number theory, including the competition's hardest problem, while AlphaGeometry 2 solved the geometry problem. The systems scored 28 points out of a possible 42, just below the gold-medal threshold of 29 points, showcasing advanced mathematical reasoning capabilities.*** <br>
   Jul 25, Google’s AlphaProof  and AlphaGeometry teams published a [blog](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/) “AI achieves silver-medal standard solving International Mathematical Olympiad problems”. Artificial general intelligence (AGI) with advanced mathematical reasoning has the potential to unlock new frontiers in science and technology. AlphaProof is a new reinforcement-learning based system for formal math reasoning, and AlphaGeometry 2, is an improved version of our geometry-solving system. Together, these systems solved four out of six problems from this year’s International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), achieving the same level as a silver medalist in the competition for the first time. The IMO is the oldest, largest and most prestigious competition for young mathematicians, held annually since 1959. More recently, the annual IMO competition has also become widely recognised as a grand challenge in machine learning and an aspirational benchmark for measuring an AI system’s advanced mathematical reasoning capabilities. AlphaProof solved two algebra problems and one number theory problem by determining the answer and proving it was correct. This included the hardest problem in the competition, solved by only five contestants at this year’s IMO. AlphaGeometry 2 proved the geometry problem, while the two combinatorics problems remained unsolved. Each of the six problems can earn seven points, with a total maximum of 42. [Google’s system achieved a final score of 28 points](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/imo-2024-solutions/index.html), earning a perfect score on each problem solved — equivalent to the top end of the silver-medal category. This year, the gold-medal threshold starts at 29 points, and was achieved by 58 of 609 contestants at the official competition. <br><br>

3. ***AI models collapse when trained on recursively generated data <br>
Researchers from several universities published findings on the risks of training AI models on data generated by other AI models. They identified a phenomenon called 'model collapse,' where the quality of models degrades due to recursive training on AI-generated content, leading to the loss of rare content features. This study emphasizes the need for human-generated data to maintain the integrity and performance of AI models over time.*** <br>
   Jul 25, Uni of Oxford, Uni of Cambridge,  Imperial College London, Uni of Toronto, Uni of Edinburgh published a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y.pdf) on Nature “AI models collapse when trained on recursively generated data”. Stable diffusion revolutionized image creation from descriptive text. GPT-2), GPT-3(.5) and GPT-4 demonstrated high performance across a variety of language tasks. ChatGPT introduced such language models to the public. It is now clear that generative artificial intelligence (AI) such as large language models (LLMs) is here to stay and will substantially change the ecosystem of online text and images. Here the authors consider what may happen to GPT-{n} once LLMs contribute much of the text found online. The paper finds that indiscriminate use of model-generated content in training causes irreversible defects in the resulting models, in which tails of the original content distribution disappear. The authors refer to this effect as ‘model collapse’ and show that it can occur in LLMs as well as in variational autoencoders (VAEs) and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). The study builds theoretical intuition behind the phenomenon and portray its ubiquity among all learned generative models. The work demonstrates that it must be taken seriously if people are to sustain the benefits of training from large-scale data scraped from the web. Indeed, the value of data collected about genuine human interactions with systems will be increasingly valuable in the presence of LLM-generated content in data crawled from the Internet. <br><br>

5. ***OpenAI's SearchGPT prototype <br>
OpenAI launched SearchGPT, a prototype integrating web information with AI model responses to provide users with fast, sourced answers. Currently in testing with a small group, SearchGPT aims to enhance ChatGPT by incorporating real-time web data. The system allows users to ask follow-up questions and aims to improve search interactions. While separate from AI training, SearchGPT ensures that publishers can manage their content's appearance in search results.*** <br>
   Jul 25, [OpenAI released](https://openai.com/index/searchgpt-prototype/) it SearchGPT, a prototype of new search features designed to combine the strength of OpenAI’s AI models with information from the web to give users fast and timely answers with clear and relevant sources. OpenAI is launching to a small group of users and publishers to get feedback. While this prototype is temporary, it plans to integrate the best of these features directly into ChatGPT in the future. SearchGPT will quickly and directly respond to users questions with up-to-date information from the web while giving clear links to relevant sources. Users will be able to ask follow-up questions, like one would in a conversation with a person, with the shared context building with each query. OpenAI has partnered with publishers to build this experience and continue to seek their feedback. In addition to launching the SearchGPT prototype, OpenAI is also launching a way for publishers to manage how they appear in SearchGPT, so publishers have more choices. Importantly, SearchGPT is about search and is separate from training OpenAI’s generative AI foundation models. Sites can be surfaced in search results even if they opt out of generative AI training. However, it is found that the answers of SearchGPT are mostly incorrect. <br><br>

7. ***Data Provenance Initiative's audit on AI data consent protocols <br>
The Data Provenance Initiative highlighted a growing crisis in data consent for AI training. Their audit of 14,000 web domains showed increasing restrictions on the use of web data for AI, with significant portions of commonly used datasets becoming inaccessible. This trend threatens the diversity and scalability of AI systems, prompting a call for more effective data consent protocols.*** <br>
   Jul 24, Data Provenance Initiative (a collective of independent and academic researchers) published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14933) “Consent in Crisis: The Rapid Decline of the AI Data Commons”. General-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems are built on massive swathes of public web data, assembled into corpora such as C4, RefinedWeb, and Dolma. To the authors’ knowledge, they conduct the first, large-scale, longitudinal audit of the consent protocols for the web domains underlying AI training corpora. The audit of 14,000 web domains provides an expansive view of crawlable web data and how consent preferences to use it are changing over time. The authors observe a proliferation of AI-specific clauses to limit use, acute differences in restrictions on AI developers, as well as general inconsistencies between websites' expressed intentions in their Terms of Service and their robots.txt. The paper diagnoses these as symptoms of ineffective web protocols, not designed to cope with the widespread re-purposing of the internet for AI. The longitudinal analyses show that in a single year (2023-2024) there has been a rapid crescendo of data restrictions from web sources, rendering ~5%+ of all tokens in C4, or 28%+ of the most actively maintained, critical sources in C4, fully restricted from use. For Terms of Service crawling restrictions, a full 45% of C4 is now restricted. If respected or enforced, these restrictions are rapidly biasing the diversity, freshness, and scaling laws for general-purpose AI systems. The authors hope to illustrate the emerging crisis in data consent, foreclosing much of the open web, not only for commercial AI, but non-commercial AI and academic purposes. <br><br>

9. ***Mistral releases Mistral Large 2 AI model <br>
Mistral unveiled Mistral Large 2, an advanced AI model with a 128k context window and support for multiple languages and coding languages. The model excels in single-node inference and boasts high accuracy on various benchmarks, including coding and reasoning.

Mistral Research License allows usage and modification for research and non-commercial usages. Mistral Large 2 sets a new frontier in terms of performance / cost of serving on evaluation metrics. In particular, on MMLU, the pretrained version achieves an accuracy of 84.0%, and sets a new point on the performance/cost Pareto front of open models. Mistral Large 2 vastly outperforms the previous Mistral Large on coding and reasoning, and performs on par with leading models such as GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, and Llama 3 405B. Additionally, the new Mistral Large 2 is trained to acknowledge when it cannot find solutions or does not have sufficient information to provide a confident answer. This commitment to accuracy is reflected in the improved model performance on popular mathematical benchmarks, demonstrating its enhanced reasoning and problem-solving skills. The new Mistral Large 2 is particularly better at following precise instructions and handling long multi-turn conversations. <br><br>

11. ***Data mixture inference study using BPE tokenizers <br>
Researchers developed a method to infer the data mixture in language model training sets using byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizers. By analyzing token frequency patterns, they accurately estimated the proportions of various data types in training sets. This method revealed new insights into the multilingual and code-focused nature of recent models like GPT-4o and Llama3, contributing to better understanding and transparency in AI model training.*** <br>
    Jul 24, Uni of Washington and Allen Inst for AI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16607) “Data Mixture Inference: What do BPE Tokenizers Reveal about their Training Data?”. The pretraining data of today's strongest language models is opaque. In particular, little is known about the proportions of various domains or languages represented. This work tackles a task which is called data mixture inference, which aims to uncover the distributional make-up of training data. The work introduces a novel attack based on a previously overlooked source of information -- byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizers, used by the vast majority of modern language models. The key insight is that the ordered list of merge rules learned by a BPE tokenizer naturally reveals information about the token frequencies in its training data: the first merge is the most common byte pair, the second is the most common pair after merging the first token, and so on. Given a tokenizer's merge list along with data samples for each category of interest, the authors formulate a linear program that solves for the proportion of each category in the tokenizer's training set. Importantly, to the extent to which tokenizer training data is representative of the pretraining data, the work indirectly learns about the pretraining data. In controlled experiments, the paper shows that the attack recovers mixture ratios with high precision for tokenizers trained on known mixtures of natural languages, programming languages, and data sources. The paper then applies the approach to off-the-shelf tokenizers released with recent LMs. The authors confirm much publicly disclosed information about these models, and also make several new inferences: GPT-4o's tokenizer is much more multilingual than its predecessors, training on 39% non-English data; Llama3 extends GPT-3.5's tokenizer primarily for multilingual (48%) use; GPT-3.5's and Claude's tokenizers are trained on predominantly code (~60%). The work sheds light on current design practices for pretraining data, and inspires continued research into data mixture inference for LMs. <br><br>

Elon Musk announced the creation of the Memphis Supercluster, a powerful AI training cluster using 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs. This initiative aims to develop the world's most powerful AI, Grok 3, by December 2023. The supercluster's scale surpasses current top supercomputers, highlighting Musk's ambitious plans for AI advancements.*** <br>
    Jul 23, according to [tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/elon-musk-fires-up-the-most-powerful-ai-training-cluster-in-the-world-uses-100000-nvidia-h100-gpus-on-a-single-fabric), Tech baron Elon Musk has taken to Twitter/X to boast of starting up “the most powerful AI training cluster in the world,” which he will use to create the self-professed "world’s most powerful AI by every metric by December of this year.” Today, xAI’s Memphis Supercluster began AI training using 100,000 liquid-cooled Nvidia H100 GPUs connected with a single RDMA (remote direct memory access) fabric. In a follow-up Tweet, Musk explains that the new supercluster will be “training the world’s most powerful AI by every metric.” From previous statements of intent, it is assumed that the power of xAI’s 100,000 H100 GPU installation will now be targeted at Grok 3 training. Musk said the refined LLM should be finished with the training stage “by December this year.” To put the Memphis Supercluster compute resources in some context, certainly, going by scale, the new xAI Memphis Supercluster easily outclasses anything in the most recent Top500 list in terms of GPU horsepower. The world’s most powerful supercomputers such as Frontier (37,888 AMD GPUs), Aurora (60,000 Intel GPUs), and Microsoft Eagle (14,400 Nvidia H100 GPUs) seem to be significantly outgunned by the xAI machine. <br><br>

    Jul 23, Meta released llama 3.1 and the corresponding [paper](https://scontent.fcbr1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=3c67a6&_nc_ohc=7qSoXLG5aAYQ7kNvgHS5YSv&_nc_ht=scontent.fcbr1-1.fna&oh=00_AYDrMk-4WCS9Y2Sa1syLLvRW05gfxbKWvz1mJleRSHbpBg&oe=66AA6F8D) “The Llama 3 Herd of Models”. Modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems are powered by foundation models. This paper presents a new set of foundation models, called Llama 3. It is a herd of language models that natively support multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. The largest model is a dense Transformer with 405B parameters and a context window of up to 128K tokens. This paper presents an extensive empirical evaluation of Llama 3. The authors find that Llama 3 delivers comparable quality to leading language models such as GPT-4 on a plethora of tasks. The authors publicly release Llama 3, including pre-trained and post-trained versions of the 405B parameter language model and the Llama Guard 3 model for input and output safety. The paper also presents the results of experiments in which integrates image, video, and speech capabilities into Llama 3 via a compositional approach. The authors observe this approach performs competitively with the state-of-the-art on image, video, and speech recognition tasks. The resulting models are not yet being broadly released as they are still under development. <br><br>

17. ***Switzerland mandates open-source software for government <br>
Switzerland passed a law requiring all government software to be open-source, promoting transparency, security, and efficiency. This legislation, part of a broader European trend, mandates public disclosure of software code and the release of non-sensitive government data as Open Government Data (OGD). The move aims to foster greater openness and practical reuse of software and data in the public sector.*** <br>
    Jul 23, [according to zdnet.com](https://www.zdnet.com/article/switzerland-now-requires-all-government-software-to-be-open-source/), Switzerland now requires all government software to be open source. Several European countries are betting on open-source software. In the United States, eh, not so much. In the latest news from across the Atlantic, Switzerland has taken a major step forward with its "Federal Law on the Use of Electronic Means for the Fulfillment of Government Tasks" (EMBAG). This groundbreaking legislation mandates using open-source software (OSS) in the public sector. This new law requires all public bodies to disclose the source code of software developed by or for them unless third-party rights or security concerns prevent it. This "public money, public code" approach aims to enhance government operations' transparency, security, and efficiency. In addition to mandating OSS, the EMBAG also requires the release of non-personal and non-security-sensitive government data as Open Government Data (OGD). This dual "open by default" approach marks a significant paradigm shift towards greater openness and practical reuse of software and data. Other countries in Europe have long supported open source. For example, in 2023, French President Macron stated, "We love open source," and France's National Gendarmerie (Think FBI if you're an American) uses Linux on its PCs. The European Union (EU) has long worked on securing OSS via the EU's Free and Open Source Software Auditing (FOSSA) project. <br><br>

19. ***OpenDevin platform for AI software developers <br>
A new platform, OpenDevin, was introduced to facilitate the development of AI agents that interact with their environment similarly to human developers. OpenDevin supports code writing, command line interaction, and web browsing, allowing for flexible and powerful AI agent development. The platform, open-sourced and community-driven, aims to enhance AI capabilities across various challenging tasks.*** <br>
    Jul 23, UIUC, CMU, Yale, UC Berkeley, ContextualAI, et al. published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16741) “OpenDevin: An Open Platform for AI Software Developers as Generalist Agents”. Software is one of the most powerful tools that humans have at our disposal; it allows a skilled programmer to interact with the world in complex and profound ways. At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with and affect change in their surrounding environments. This paper introduces OpenDevin, a platform for the development of powerful and flexible AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a human developer: by writing code, interacting with a command line, and browsing the web. The authors describe how the platform allows for the implementation of new agents, safe interaction with sandboxed environments for code execution, coordination between multiple agents, and incorporation of evaluation benchmarks. Based on the currently incorporated benchmarks, the authors perform an evaluation of agents over 15 challenging tasks, including software engineering (e.g., SWE-Bench) and web browsing (e.g., WebArena), among others. Released under the permissive MIT license, [OpenDevin](https://github.com/OpenDevin/OpenDevin) is a community project spanning academia and industry with more than 1.3K contributions from over 160 contributors and will improve going forward. <br><br>

21. ***Comparison of KAN and MLP models <br>
Researchers conducted a comprehensive comparison of KAN and MLP models, finding that MLP generally outperforms KAN across various tasks, except for symbolic formula representation. The study also identified the B-spline activation function as a key factor in KAN's performance in symbolic tasks. These findings offer insights for future research on model alternatives and improvements.*** <br>
    Jul 23, Nation Uni of Singapore published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16674) “KAN or MLP: A Fairer Comparison”. This paper does not introduce a novel method. Instead, it offers a fairer and more comprehensive comparison of KAN and MLP models across various tasks, including machine learning, computer vision, audio processing, natural language processing, and symbolic formula representation. Specifically, the authors control the number of parameters and FLOPs to compare the performance of KAN and MLP. The main observation is that, except for symbolic formula representation tasks, MLP generally outperforms KAN. The authors also conduct ablation studies on KAN and find that its advantage in symbolic formula representation mainly stems from its B-spline activation function. When B-spline is applied to MLP, performance in symbolic formula representation significantly improves, surpassing or matching that of KAN. However, in other tasks where MLP already excels over KAN, B-spline does not substantially enhance MLP's performance. Furthermore, the study finds that KAN's forgetting issue is more severe than that of MLP in a standard class-incremental continual learning setting, which differs from the findings reported in the KAN paper. The authors hope these results provide insights for future research on KAN and other MLP alternatives. Project link: https://github.com/yu-rp/KANbeFair <br><br>

23. ***Specialization for legal tasks using Llama 3 <br>
A study demonstrated that fine-tuned Llama 3 models significantly outperform GPT-4 on legal text classification tasks. The research showed that even light fine-tuning on specific tasks could achieve high accuracy, suggesting a viable alternative to using commercial models for legal research. This approach could reduce reliance on costly human annotation.*** <br>
    Jul 23, Tubingen AI Center, Harvard Uni, ETH Zurich, Washington Uni and Uni of Virginia published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16615) “Lawma: The Power of Specialization for Legal Tasks”. Annotation and classification of legal text are central components of empirical legal research. Traditionally, these tasks are often delegated to trained research assistants. Motivated by the advances in language modeling, empirical legal scholars are increasingly turning to prompting commercial models, hoping that it will alleviate the significant cost of human annotation. Despite growing use, the understanding of how to best utilize large language models for legal tasks remains limited. The work conducts a comprehensive study of 260 legal text classification tasks, nearly all new to the machine learning community. Starting from GPT-4 as a baseline, the paper shows that it has non-trivial but highly varied zero-shot accuracy, often exhibiting performance that may be insufficient for legal work. The authors then demonstrate that a lightly fine-tuned Llama 3 model vastly outperforms GPT-4 on almost all tasks, typically by double-digit percentage points. The authors find that larger models respond better to fine-tuning than smaller models. A few tens to hundreds of examples suffice to achieve high classification accuracy. Notably, the authors can fine-tune a single model on all 260 tasks simultaneously at a small loss in accuracy relative to having a separate model for each task. The work points to a viable alternative to the predominant practice of prompting commercial models. For concrete legal tasks with some available labeled data, researchers are better off using a fine-tuned open-source model. <br><br>

25. ***Local vs global continual learning <br>
Researchers explored continual learning strategies, comparing local and global approximations. They classified existing algorithms based on these strategies and assessed their practical effects. The study highlighted the importance of understanding continual learning mechanisms to develop effective strategies for integrating new information while retaining past knowledge.*** <br>
    Jul 23, ETH Zurich published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16611) on CoLLAs 2024 “Local vs Global continual learning”.  Continual learning is the problem of integrating new information in a model while retaining the knowledge acquired in the past. Despite the tangible improvements achieved in recent years, the problem of continual learning is still an open one. A better understanding of the mechanisms behind the successes and failures of existing continual learning algorithms can unlock the development of new successful strategies. This work views continual learning from the perspective of the multi-task loss approximation, and compares two alternative strategies, namely local and global approximations. The authors classify existing continual learning algorithms based on the approximation used, and assess the practical effects of this distinction in common continual learning settings. Additionally, the authors study optimal continual learning objectives in the case of local polynomial approximations and provide examples of existing algorithms implementing the optimal objectives. <br><br>

27. ***Shared hallucinations in LLMs <br>
Salesforce's study on large language models (LLMs) revealed that these models share a 'shared imagination space,' enabling them to answer each other's imaginary questions with high success. This phenomenon suggests a commonality in the models' training and hallucination processes, raising questions about model homogeneity and computational creativity.*** <br>
    Jul 23, Salesforce published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16604) “Shared Imagination: LLMs Hallucinate Alike”. Despite the recent proliferation of large language models (LLMs), their training recipes -- model architecture, pre-training data and optimization algorithm -- are often very similar. This naturally raises the question of the similarity among the resulting models. This paper proposes a novel setting, imaginary question answering (IQA), to better understand model similarity. In IQA, the authors ask one model to generate purely imaginary questions (e.g., on completely made-up concepts in physics) and prompt another model to answer. Surprisingly, despite the total fictionality of these questions, all models can answer each other's questions with remarkable success, suggesting a "shared imagination space" in which these models operate during such hallucinations. The authors conduct a series of investigations into this phenomenon and discuss implications on model homogeneity, hallucination, and computational creativity. <br><br>

29. ***Training-free baseline for video LLMs <br>
Apple proposed SlowFast-LLaVA, a training-free video LLM that captures detailed spatial semantics and long-range temporal context. The two-stream design effectively aggregates features from video frames, outperforming existing training-free methods on video tasks. This approach offers a strong baseline for video LLMs without the need for extensive training.*** <br>
    Jul 22, Apple published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15841) “SlowFast-LLaVA: A Strong Training-Free Baseline for Video Large Language Models”. The paper proposes SlowFast-LLaVA (or SF-LLaVA for short), a training-free video large language model (LLM) that can jointly capture the detailed spatial semantics and long-range temporal context without exceeding the token budget of commonly used LLMs. This is realized by using a two-stream SlowFast design of inputs for Video LLMs to aggregate features from sampled video frames in an effective way. Specifically, the Slow pathway extracts features at a low frame rate while keeping as many spatial details as possible (e.g., with 24x24 tokens), and the Fast pathway operates on a high frame rate but uses a larger spatial pooling stride (e.g., downsampling 6x) to focus on the motion cues. As a result, this design allows adequately capturing both spatial and temporal features that are beneficial for understanding details along the video. Experimental results show that SF-LLaVA outperforms existing training-free methods on a wide range of video tasks. On some benchmarks, it achieves comparable or even better performance compared to state-of-the-art Video LLMs that are fine-tuned on video datasets. <br><br>

An analysis of AI-based startups backed by YCombinator highlighted trends in AI innovation, investment, and founder backgrounds. Key findings include a focus on B2B solutions, opportunities in underserved sectors, and the importance of technical expertise. The study also noted the growing interest in generative AI and the need for ethical AI considerations.*** <br>
    Jul 19, High Signal AI published a [blog](https://highsignalai.substack.com/p/what-i-learned-from-looking-at-400) “What I learned from looking at 400 AI-based Startups backed by YCombinator”. YCombinator's (YC) track record in identifying and nurturing successful startups is unparalleled in the tech industry. Their selection process has consistently surfaced companies that go on to reshape entire sectors, making their portfolio a valuable indicator of emerging trends and technologies.  The author was looking for answers to questions like which sectors are seeing the most AI innovation? What types of AI applications are attracting investment? What backgrounds do successful AI founders have? This study aims to provide insights into: 1) The hottest industries and sectors for AI startups. 2) Areas ripe for AI disruption. 3) AI in emerging technologies like blockchain and quantum computing. 4) Companies working in AI Safety, Accessibility, Explainability. 5) Common traits among YC-backed AI founders. 6) How to find what you should build with AI using the above insights. Key finds are: 1) Focus on B2B: With 81.1% of YC-backed AI startups targeting businesses, consider enterprise solutions for higher chances of funding and success. 2) Explore Underserved Sectors: While healthcare/biotech (10.8%), fintech (9.1%), and developer tools (8.9%) dominate, look for opportunities in neglected areas like manufacturing (1%) or agriculture (0.7%). 3) Prioritize Technical Expertise: Ensure your founding team includes strong technical talent, as 74.8% of YC-backed AI companies have at least one founder with a robust technical background. 4) Capitalize on Generative AI: With 18.7% of startups in this space, generative AI is hot. However, consider how you can apply it innovatively to stand out. 5) Address Ethical Concerns: Only 1.2% of startups focus on ethical AI. This gap represents a significant opportunity for forward-thinking founders. <br><br>

33. ***Pruning and knowledge distillation for LLMs <br>
Nvidia's study on compressing language models through pruning and knowledge distillation demonstrated significant compute cost savings and performance improvements. The approach reduced training data requirements and maintained high accuracy, offering an efficient alternative to training large models from scratch. The compressed models performed well compared to other community models and state-of-the-art compression techniques.*** <br>
    Jul 19, Nvidia published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14679) “Compact Language Models via Pruning and Knowledge Distillation”. Large language models (LLMs) targeting different deployment scales and sizes are currently produced by training each variant from scratch; this is extremely compute-intensive. This paper investigates if pruning an existing LLM and then re-training it with a fraction (<3%) of the original training data can be a suitable alternative to repeated, full retraining. To this end, the study develops a set of practical and effective compression best practices for LLMs that combine depth, width, attention and MLP pruning with knowledge distillation-based retraining; and arrives at these best practices through a detailed empirical exploration of pruning strategies for each axis, methods to combine axes, distillation strategies, and search techniques for arriving at optimal compressed architectures. The paper uses this guide to compress the Nemotron-4 family of LLMs by a factor of 2-4x, and compare their performance to similarly-sized models on a variety of language modeling tasks. Deriving 8B and 4B models from an already pretrained 15B model using the approach requires up to 40x fewer training tokens per model compared to training from scratch; this results in compute cost savings of 1.8x for training the full model family (15B, 8B, and 4B). Minitron models exhibit up to a 16% improvement in MMLU scores compared to training from scratch, perform comparably to other community models such as Mistral 7B, Gemma 7B and Llama-3 8B, and outperform state-of-the-art compression techniques from the literature. The authors have [open-sourced Minitron](https://github.com/NVlabs/Minitron) model weights on Huggingface, with corresponding supplementary material including example code available on GitHub. <br><br>

35. ***Long-context language models benchmark <br>
Researchers created NoCha, a benchmark for long-context language models, testing their ability to retrieve, synthesize, and reason over book-length inputs. The dataset consists of pairs of true and false claims about books, requiring global reasoning. The study found that current LLMs struggle with these tasks, highlighting the need for further improvements in long-context comprehension.*** <br>
    Jul 18, UMass Amherst, Allen Inst of AI, and Princeton Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16264) “One Thousand and One Pairs: A "novel" challenge for long-context language models”. Synthetic long-context LLM benchmarks (e.g., "needle-in-the-haystack") test only surface-level retrieval capabilities, but how well can long-context LLMs retrieve, synthesize, and reason over information across book-length inputs? The paper addresses this question by creating NoCha, a dataset of 1,001 minimally different pairs of true and false claims about 67 recently-published English fictional books, written by human readers of those books. In contrast to existing long-context benchmarks, the annotators confirm that the largest share of pairs in NoCha require global reasoning over the entire book to verify. The experiments show that while human readers easily perform this task, it is enormously challenging for all ten long-context LLMs that evaluated: no open-weight model performs above random chance (despite their strong performance on synthetic benchmarks), while GPT-4o achieves the highest accuracy at 55.8%. Further analysis reveals that (1) on average, models perform much better on pairs that require only sentence-level retrieval vs. global reasoning; (2) model-generated explanations for their decisions are often inaccurate even for correctly-labeled claims; and (3) models perform substantially worse on speculative fiction books that contain extensive world-building. The methodology proposed in NoCha allows for the evolution of the benchmark dataset and the easy analysis of future models. <br><br>

37. ***AI Agents That Matter <br>
The paper highlights several issues with current AI agent benchmarks, such as an overemphasis on accuracy, lack of attention to costs, conflation of benchmarking needs, inadequate holdout sets, and poor standardization in evaluation practices. The authors propose optimizing both accuracy and cost, distinguishing benchmarking needs, addressing overfitting, and standardizing evaluations to develop more practical and reliable AI agents.*** <br>
    Jul 1, Princeton Uni published [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01502) “AI Agents That Matter”. AI agents are an exciting new research direction, and agent development is driven by benchmarks. An analysis of current agent benchmarks and evaluation practices reveals several shortcomings that hinder their usefulness in real-world applications. First, there is a narrow focus on accuracy without attention to other metrics. As a result, SOTA agents are needlessly complex and costly, and the community has reached mistaken conclusions about the sources of accuracy gains. The focus on cost in addition to accuracy motivates the new goal of jointly optimizing the two metrics. The authors design and implement one such optimization, showing its potential to greatly reduce cost while maintaining accuracy. Second, the benchmarking needs of model and downstream developers have been conflated, making it hard to identify which agent would be best suited for a particular application. Third, many agent benchmarks have inadequate holdout sets, and sometimes none at all. This has led to agents that are fragile because they take shortcuts and overfit to the benchmark in various ways. The research prescribes a principled framework for avoiding overfitting. Finally, there is a lack of standardization in evaluation practices, leading to a pervasive lack of reproducibility. The authors hope that the steps introduced for addressing these shortcomings will spur the development of agents that are useful in the real world and not just accurate on benchmarks.

1. ***Mistral NeMo Released: <br>
Mistral released Mistral NeMo, a 12B model with a 128k context length, under the Apache 2.0 license. It’s a global, multilingual model with strengths in English, French, Chinese, and Hindi, and uses a new tokenizer, Tekken, which outperforms the previous SentencePiece tokenizer. Mistral NeMo is better at instruction following, reasoning, multi-turn conversations, and code generation compared to its predecessor, Mistral 7B.*** <br>
   Jul 18, [Mistral released Mistral NeMo](https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-nemo/), a state-of-the-art 12B model with 128k context length, and released under the Apache 2.0 license. As it relies on standard architecture, Mistral NeMo is easy to use and a drop-in replacement in any system using Mistral 7B. The model is designed for global, multilingual applications. It is trained on function calling, has a large context window, and is particularly strong in English, French, Chinese, and Hindi. Mistral NeMo uses a new tokenizer, Tekken, based on Tiktoken, that was trained on over more than 100 languages, and compresses natural language text and source code more efficiently than the SentencePiece tokenizer used in previous Mistral models. Compared to the Llama 3 tokenizer, Tekken proved to be more proficient in compressing text for approximately 85% of all languages. Mistral NeMO underwent an advanced fine-tuning and alignment phase. Compared to Mistral 7B, it is much better at following precise instructions, reasoning, handling multi-turn conversations, and generating code. <br><br>

3. ***OpenAI Paper on LLM Legibility: <br>
OpenAI published a paper on improving LLM output legibility using Prover-Verifier Games. This method enhances the clarity and checkability of solutions in math problems by training verifiers and provers. Results show increased human accuracy in verifying solutions, suggesting this method could align LLMs more closely with human-checkable outputs.*** <br>
   Jul 18, OpenAI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13692) “Prover-Verifier Games improve legibility of LLM outputs”. One way to increase confidence in the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs) is to support them with reasoning that is clear and easy to check -- a property call legibility. The paper studies legibility in the context of solving grade-school math problems and show that optimizing chain-of-thought solutions only for answer correctness can make them less legible. To mitigate the loss in legibility, the authors propose a training algorithm inspired by Prover-Verifier Game from Anil et al. (2021). The algorithm iteratively trains small verifiers to predict solution correctness, "helpful" provers to produce correct solutions that the verifier accepts, and "sneaky" provers to produce incorrect solutions that fool the verifier. The study finds that the helpful prover's accuracy and the verifier's robustness to adversarial attacks increase over the course of training. Furthermore, the paper shows that legibility training transfers to time-constrained humans tasked with verifying solution correctness. Over course of LLM training human accuracy increases when checking the helpful prover's solutions, and decreases when checking the sneaky prover's solutions. Hence, training for checkability by small verifiers is a plausible technique for increasing output legibility. The results suggest legibility training against small verifiers as a practical avenue for increasing legibility of large LLMs to humans, and thus could help with alignment of superhuman models. <br><br>

5. ***MetaSumPerceiver for Fact-Checking: <br>
Virginia Tech introduced MetaSumPerceiver, a model designed for fact-checking claims by summarizing multimodal, multi-document datasets. Using a dynamic perceiver-based model and reinforcement learning, it outperforms existing approaches on the MOCHEG dataset and demonstrates strong performance on a new fact-checking dataset.*** <br>
   Jul 18, Virginia Tech published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13089) on ACM 2024 “MetaSumPerceiver: Multimodal Multi-Document Evidence Summarization for Fact-Checking”. Fact-checking real-world claims often requires reviewing multiple multimodal documents to assess a claim's truthfulness, which is a highly laborious and time-consuming task. This paper presents a summarization model designed to generate claim-specific summaries useful for fact-checking from multimodal, multi-document datasets. The model takes inputs in the form of documents, images, and a claim, with the objective of assisting in fact-checking tasks. The paper introduces a dynamic perceiver-based model that can handle inputs from multiple modalities of arbitrary lengths. To train the model, the authors leverage a novel reinforcement learning-based entailment objective to generate summaries that provide evidence distinguishing between different truthfulness labels. To assess the efficacy of the approach, the authors conduct experiments on both an existing benchmark and a new dataset of multi-document claims. The proposed approach outperforms the SOTA approach by 4.6% in the claim verification task on the MOCHEG dataset and demonstrates strong performance on the new Multi-News-Fact-Checking dataset. <br><br>

7. ***OpenAI's GPT-4o Mini: <br>
OpenAI released GPT-4o mini, a cost-effective model scoring 82% on the MMLU. Priced significantly lower than previous models, it supports a wide range of tasks and has a large context window. The model is designed for efficient and low-latency applications, with future support for multiple input and output types.*** <br>
   Jul 18, OpenAI [released GPT-4o mini](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-intelligence/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email), scores 82% on MMLU and currently outperforms GPT-41 on chat preferences in LMSYS leaderboard(opens in a new window). It is priced at 15 cents per million input tokens and 60 cents per million output tokens, an order of magnitude more affordable than previous frontier models and more than 60% cheaper than GPT-3.5 Turbo. GPT-4o mini enables a broad range of tasks with its low cost and latency, such as applications that chain or parallelize multiple model calls (e.g., calling multiple APIs), pass a large volume of context to the model (e.g., full code base or conversation history), or interact with customers through fast, real-time text responses (e.g., customer support chatbots).  GPT-4o mini supports text and vision in the API, with support for text, image, video and audio inputs and outputs coming in the future. The model has a context window of 128K tokens, supports up to 16K output tokens per request, and has knowledge up to October 2023. <br><br>

9. ***IBM and MIT on Benchmark Agreement Testing: <br>
IBM and MIT highlighted issues in Benchmark Agreement Testing (BAT) for LLMs and proposed best practices to ensure robust and valid evaluations. They introduced BenchBench, a tool for BAT, and demonstrated the importance of standardized procedures in improving the reliability of benchmark evaluations.*** <br>
    Jul 18, IBM and MIT published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13696) “Benchmark Agreement Testing Done Right: A Guide for LLM Benchmark Evaluation”. Recent advancements in Language Models (LMs) have catalyzed the creation of multiple benchmarks, designed to assess these models' general capabilities. A crucial task, however, is assessing the validity of the benchmarks themselves. This is most commonly done via Benchmark Agreement Testing (BAT), where new benchmarks are validated against established ones using some agreement metric (e.g., rank correlation). Despite the crucial role of BAT for benchmark builders and consumers, there are no standardized procedures for such agreement testing. This deficiency can lead to invalid conclusions, fostering mistrust in benchmarks and upending the ability to properly choose the appropriate benchmark to use. By analyzing over 40 prominent benchmarks, the authors demonstrate how some overlooked methodological choices can significantly influence BAT results, potentially undermining the validity of conclusions. To address these inconsistencies, the study proposes a set of best practices for BAT and demonstrate how utilizing these methodologies greatly improves BAT robustness and validity. To foster adoption and facilitate future research, the paper introduces BenchBench, a python package for BAT, and release the BenchBench-leaderboard, a meta-benchmark designed to evaluate benchmarks using their peers. Findings of the paper underscore the necessity for standardized BAT, ensuring the robustness and validity of benchmark evaluations in the evolving landscape of language model research.

11. ***Open-Source LLMs in Biomedical Tasks: <br>
A study explored the performance of open-source LLMs like Mixtral 8x7B compared to commercial models in biomedical tasks. While competitive in few-shot settings, open-source models struggled in zero-shot scenarios. The research suggests that domain-specific few-shot examples can close the performance gap between commercial and open-source models.*** <br>
    Jul 18, Uni of Regensburg published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13511) “Can Open-Source LLMs Compete with Commercial Models? Exploring the Few-Shot Performance of Current GPT Models in Biomedical Tasks”. Commercial large language models (LLMs), like OpenAI's GPT-4 powering ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus, have dominated natural language processing (NLP) benchmarks across different domains. New competing Open-Source alternatives like Mixtral 8x7B or Llama 3 have emerged and seem to be closing the gap while often offering higher throughput and being less costly to use. Open-Source LLMs can also be self-hosted, which makes them interesting for enterprise and clinical use cases where sensitive data should not be processed by third parties. The authors participated in the 12th BioASQ challenge, which is a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) setting, and explored the performance of current GPT models Claude 3 Opus, GPT-3.5-turbo and Mixtral 8x7b with in-context learning (zero-shot, few-shot) and QLoRa fine-tuning. The study also explored how additional relevant knowledge from Wikipedia added to the context-window of the LLM might improve their performance. Mixtral 8x7b was competitive in the 10-shot setting, both with and without fine-tuning, but failed to produce usable results in the zero-shot setting. QLoRa fine-tuning and Wikipedia context did not lead to measurable performance gains. The results indicate that the performance gap between commercial and open-source models in RAG setups exists mainly in the zero-shot setting and can be closed by simply collecting few-shot examples for domain-specific use cases. The code needed to rerun these experiments is available through [GitHub](https://github.com/SamyAteia/bioasq2024).  <br><br>

13. ***AI and Universal Basic Income: <br>
An article in Forbes discussed the impact of AI and robotics on job displacement, suggesting a shift towards human-AI collaboration. It proposes that universal basic income may become necessary as AI makes many traditional jobs obsolete, emphasizing the enduring need for human skills in the workforce.*** <br>
    Jul 17, Forbes published an [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/07/17/ai-robot-job-displacement-universal-basic-income/) “How AI And Robot Job Displacements Could Lead Us Down The Road Of Universal Basic Income And Loss Of Identity”. The article argues that in today’s evolving workplace landscape, AI and robotics are already automating tasks across almost all sectors, including manufacturing, data analysis, customer service and administration. As it stands, repetitive and routine tasks are the most susceptible to automation. While AI and robotics will undoubtedly change the nature of work, it's unlikely that these technologies will eradicate the existence of all jobs. The focus will likely shift toward human-AI collaboration and jobs requiring uniquely human skills. The future of work could involve a combination of paid employment, universal basic income and a renewed focus on finding meaning and fulfillment outside of traditional work structures. Many jobs require creativity, critical thinking, social skills, problem-solving under pressure and the ability to handle unforeseen situations. Because these are areas where AI is still limited, it demonstrates the need for continued human skills in job functions. Elon Musk stated this May in Pairs that AI will eventually make workers obsolete—a prediction he doesn’t necessarily see as pernicious. Highly advanced AI capabilities will dispel the need for human labor, rendering traditional jobs unnecessary, in what he frames as a likely "benign scenario" for the future of work. Musk sees people working simply out of personal interest or creative satisfaction. For work to become optional, we would need to live in an “age of abundance” achieved by "universal high income," Musk said. Geoffrey Hinton told BBC that universal basic income would need to be provided by the government to provide a safety net, if automation catalyzes widespread job displacement. <br><br>

15. ***Manipulating LLM Uncertainty: <br>
Research from Rutgers, NYU, and Meta investigated the fragility of uncertainty estimation in LLMs. They demonstrated that backdoor attacks could manipulate model uncertainty without changing the output, highlighting a significant threat to LLM reliability and the need for defenses against such vulnerabilities.*** <br>
    Jul 17, Rutgers Uni, NYU, Meta, et al. published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11282) “Uncertainty is Fragile: Manipulating Uncertainty in Large Language Models”. Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed across various high-stakes domains, where the reliability of their outputs is crucial. One commonly used method to assess the reliability of LLMs' responses is uncertainty estimation, which gauges the likelihood of their answers being correct. While many studies focus on improving the accuracy of uncertainty estimations for LLMs, this research investigates the fragility of uncertainty estimation and explores potential attacks. The authors demonstrate that an attacker can embed a backdoor in LLMs, which, when activated by a specific trigger in the input, manipulates the model's uncertainty without affecting the final output. Specifically, the proposed backdoor attack method can alter an LLM's output probability distribution, causing the probability distribution to converge towards an attacker-predefined distribution while ensuring that the top-1 prediction remains unchanged. Experimental results demonstrate that this attack effectively undermines the model's self-evaluation reliability in multiple-choice questions. For instance, the study achieved a 100 attack success rate (ASR) across three different triggering strategies in four models. Further, the authors investigate whether this manipulation generalizes across different prompts and domains. This work highlights a significant threat to the reliability of LLMs and underscores the need for future defenses against such attacks.

17. ***Goldfish for Long Video Understanding: <br>
KAUST, Harvard, and Swiss AI Lab introduced Goldfish, a methodology for understanding long videos. It uses efficient retrieval mechanisms and a new benchmark, TVQA-long, to improve comprehension of lengthy video content. Goldfish outperforms previous methods in both long and short video understanding.*** <br>
    Jul 17, KAUST, Harvard Uni and The Swiss AI Lab published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12679) “Goldfish: Vision-Language Understanding of Arbitrarily Long Videos”. Most current LLM-based models for video understanding can process videos within minutes. However, they struggle with lengthy videos due to challenges such as "noise and redundancy", as well as "memory and computation" constraints. This paper presents Goldfish, a methodology tailored for comprehending videos of arbitrary lengths. The work also introduces the TVQA-long benchmark, specifically designed to evaluate models' capabilities in understanding long videos with questions in both vision and text content. Goldfish approaches these challenges with an efficient retrieval mechanism that initially gathers the top-k video clips relevant to the instruction before proceeding to provide the desired response. This design of the retrieval mechanism enables the Goldfish to efficiently process arbitrarily long video sequences, facilitating its application in contexts such as movies or television series. To facilitate the retrieval process, the study developed MiniGPT4-Video that generates detailed descriptions for the video clips. In addressing the scarcity of benchmarks for long video evaluation, the paper adapted the TVQA short video benchmark for extended content analysis by aggregating questions from entire episodes, thereby shifting the evaluation from partial to full episode comprehension. The study attained a 41.78% accuracy rate on the TVQA-long benchmark, surpassing previous methods by 14.94%. The MiniGPT4-Video also shows exceptional performance in short video comprehension, exceeding existing state-of-the-art methods by 3.23%, 2.03%, 16.5% and 23.59% on the MSVD, MSRVTT, TGIF, and TVQA short video benchmarks, respectively. These results indicate that these models have significant improvements in both long and short-video understanding.

19. ***Foundation Model Transparency Index v1.1: <br>
A follow-up study from Stanford, Princeton, and MIT assessed the transparency of foundation model developers. The updated index shows improved transparency, with developers now scoring 58 out of 100 on average. The study highlights areas of ongoing opacity and suggests that increased transparency can be achieved through policy interventions.*** <br>
    Jul 17, Stanford Uni, Princeton Uni and MIT published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12929) “The Foundation Model Transparency Index v1.1: May 2024”. Foundation models are increasingly consequential yet extremely opaque. To characterize the status quo, the Foundation Model Transparency Index was launched in October 2023 to measure the transparency of leading foundation model developers. The October 2023 Index (v1.0) assessed 10 major foundation model developers (e.g. OpenAI, Google) on 100 transparency indicators (e.g. does the developer disclose the wages it pays for data labor?). At the time, developers publicly disclosed very limited information with the average score being 37 out of 100. To understand how the status quo has changed, the researchers conduct a follow-up study (v1.1) after 6 months: the report scores 14 developers against the same 100 indicators. While in v1.0 the authors searched for publicly available information, in v1.1 developers submit reports on the 100 transparency indicators, potentially including information that was not previously public. The report finds that developers now score 58 out of 100 on average, a 21 point improvement over v1.0. Much of this increase is driven by developers disclosing information during the v1.1 process: on average, developers disclosed information related to 16.6 indicators that was not previously public. The authors observe regions of sustained (i.e. across v1.0 and v1.1) and systemic (i.e. across most or all developers) opacity such as on copyright status, data access, data labor, and downstream impact. The authors publish transparency reports for each developer that consolidate information disclosures: these reports are based on the information disclosed to the authors via developers. The findings demonstrate that transparency can be improved in this nascent ecosystem, the Foundation Model Transparency Index likely contributes to these improvements, and policymakers should consider interventions in areas where transparency has not improved. <br><br>

23. ***High Performance RWKV/Transformer and Extreme KV-Cache Compression:  <br>
The paper introduces GoldFinch, a hybrid model combining Linear Attention and Transformer techniques to efficiently generate a compressed KV-Cache. GoldFinch enhances performance relative to previous models and saves cache size significantly. Despite the complexity of autoregressive generation, the pre-fill computation remains efficient due to the use of RNNs. The trained weights and codes are released for community use.*** <br>
    Jul 16, EleutherAI et al. published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12077) “GoldFinch: High Performance RWKV/Transformer Hybrid with Linear Pre-Fill and Extreme KV-Cache Compression”. The paper introduces GoldFinch, a hybrid Linear Attention/Transformer sequence model that uses a new technique to efficiently generate a highly compressed and reusable KV-Cache in linear time and space with respect to sequence length. GoldFinch stacks a new GOLD transformer on top of an enhanced version of the Finch (RWKV-6) architecture. The authors train up to 1.5B parameter class models of the Finch, Llama, and GoldFinch architectures, and find dramatically improved modeling performance relative to both Finch and Llama. The cache size savings increase linearly with model layer count, ranging from 756-2550 times smaller than the traditional transformer cache for common sizes, enabling inference of extremely large context lengths even on limited hardware. Although autoregressive generation has O(n) time complexity per token because of attention, pre-fill computation of the entire initial cache state for a submitted context costs only O(1) time per token due to the use of a recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate this cache. Trained weights and training [codes](https://github.com/recursal/GoldFinch-paper) are released under the Apache 2.0 license for community use. <br><br>

25. ***A Realistic and Challenging Benchmark for Reasoning-Intensive Retrieval: <br>
Existing benchmarks focus on simple queries, but BRIGHT addresses the need for benchmarks requiring deep reasoning. BRIGHT includes 1,398 real-world queries across various domains and shows that current retrieval models perform poorly on it. The use of Chain-of-Thought reasoning improves performance. BRIGHT is robust against data leakage and encourages research on more challenging retrieval tasks. Code and data are publicly available.*** <br>
    Jul 16, The Uni of Hong Kong, Princeton Uni, Uni of Washington and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12883) “BRIGHT: A Realistic and Challenging Benchmark for Reasoning-Intensive Retrieval”. Existing retrieval benchmarks primarily consist of information-seeking queries (e.g., aggregated questions from search engines) where keyword or semantic-based retrieval is usually sufficient. However, many complex real-world queries require in-depth reasoning to identify relevant documents that go beyond surface form matching. For example, finding documentation for a coding question requires understanding the logic and syntax of the functions involved. To better benchmark retrieval on such challenging queries, the paper introduces BRIGHT, the first text retrieval benchmark that requires intensive reasoning to retrieve relevant documents. BRIGHT is constructed from the 1,398 real-world queries collected from diverse domains (such as economics, psychology, robotics, software engineering, earth sciences, etc.), sourced from naturally occurring or carefully curated human data. Extensive evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art retrieval models perform poorly on BRIGHT. The leading model on the MTEB leaderboard, which achieves a score of 59.0 nDCG@10,2 produces a score of nDCG@10 of 18.0 on BRIGHT. The authors further demonstrate that augmenting queries with Chain-of-Thought reasoning generated by large language models (LLMs) improves performance by up to 12.2 points. Moreover, BRIGHT is robust against data leakage during pretraining of the benchmarked models as the authors validate by showing similar performance even when documents from the benchmark are included in the training data. BRIGHT paves the way for future research on retrieval systems in more realistic and challenging settings. Code and data are available at https://brightbenchmark.github.io. <br><br>

27. ***All Large Language Models can be Fully Sparsely-Activated: <br>
Q-Sparse enables efficient training of sparsely-activated large language models (LLMs) through top-K sparsification and the straight-through-estimator. It achieves comparable results to baseline LLMs with significant efficiency gains in inference. Q-Sparse is versatile across different training settings and is effective for both full-precision and 1-bit LLMs, promising to revolutionize future LLM efficiency.*** <br>
    Jul 15, Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10969) “Q-Sparse: All Large Language Models can be Fully Sparsely-Activated”.  The paper introduces, Q-Sparse, a simple yet effective approach to training sparsely-activated large language models (LLMs). Q-Sparse enables full sparsity of activations in LLMs which can bring significant efficiency gains in inference. This is achieved by applying top-K sparsification to the activations and the straight-through-estimator to the training. The key results from this work are, (1) Q-Sparse can achieve results comparable to those of baseline LLMs while being much more efficient at inference time; (2) the paper presents an inference-optimal scaling law for sparsely-activated LLMs; (3) Q-Sparse is effective in different settings, including training-from-scratch, continue-training of off-the-shelf LLMs, and finetuning; (4) Q-Sparse works for both full-precision and 1-bit LLMs (e.g., BitNet b1.58). Particularly, the synergy of BitNet b1.58 and Q-Sparse (can be equipped with MoE) provides the cornerstone and a clear path to revolutionize the efficiency, including cost and energy consumption, of future LLMs. <br><br>

29. ***Taming Large Language Models for Better Automatic Evaluation: <br>
FLAMe, a family of autorater models, enhances the evaluation of LLMs by training on a diverse set of quality assessment tasks. FLAMe outperforms proprietary models like GPT-4 on many tasks and serves as a robust starting point for fine-tuning. It is also more efficient and less biased than other models, excelling in identifying high-quality responses for various tasks.*** <br>
    Jul 15, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10817) “Foundational Autoraters: Taming Large Language Models for Better Automatic Evaluation”. As large language models (LLMs) advance, it becomes more challenging to reliably evaluate their output due to the high costs of human evaluation. To make progress towards better LLM autoraters, the paper introduces FLAMe, a family of Foundational Large Autorater Models. FLAMe is trained on Google’s large and diverse collection of 100+ quality assessment tasks comprising 5M+ human judgments, curated and standardized using publicly released human evaluations from previous research. FLAMe significantly improves generalization to a wide variety of held-out tasks, outperforming LLMs trained on proprietary data like GPT-4 and Claude-3 on many tasks. The study shows that FLAMe can also serve as a powerful starting point for further downstream fine-tuning, using reward modeling evaluation as a case study (FLAMe-RM). Notably, on RewardBench, the FLAMe-RM-24B model (with an accuracy of 87.8%) is the top-performing generative model trained exclusively on permissively licensed data, outperforming both GPT-4-0125 (85.9%) and GPT-4o (84.7%). Additionally, the study explores a more computationally efficient approach using a novel tail-patch fine-tuning strategy to optimize the FLAMe multitask mixture for reward modeling evaluation (FLAMe-Opt-RM), offering competitive RewardBench performance while requiring approximately 25x less training datapoints. Overall, the FLAMe variants outperform all popular proprietary LLM-as-a-Judge models considered across 8 out of 12 autorater evaluation benchmarks, encompassing 53 quality assessment tasks, including RewardBench and LLM-AggreFact. Finally, analysis reveals that FLAMe is significantly less biased than these LLM-as-a-Judge models on the CoBBLEr autorater bias benchmark, while effectively identifying high-quality responses for code generation.  <br><br>

31. ***How Low-Rank Weights Non-uniformly Emerge from Low-Rank Gradients: <br>
The paper studies low-rank structures in LLMs and introduces WeLore for weight compression and memory-efficient fine-tuning. WeLore leverages gradient dynamics to identify suitable rank reduction ratios, enabling significant performance and efficiency improvements. The technique outperforms full finetuning while reducing memory and computational requirements, making it a powerful tool for optimizing LLMs.*** <br>
    Jul 15, Uni of Texas at Austin Uni of Oxford, Meta, et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11239) “From GaLore to WeLore: How Low-Rank Weights Non-uniformly Emerge from Low-Rank Gradients”. Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are composed of matrices with billions of elements, making their storage and processing quite demanding in terms of computational resources and memory usage. Being significantly large, such matrices can often be expressed in low-rank format with potential to relax resource requirements. Unlike prior works which focus on developing novel matrix decomposition algorithms, this work first studies the emergence of low-rank structures across matrices within different layers of LLMs and establish a consequential relationship between the gradient dynamics and emerging low-rank expressiveness of matrices. Findings reveal that different layers exhibit varying levels of converged low-rank structure, necessitating a non-uniform rank reduction across them to minimize performance drop due to compression. In view of that, the paper presents Weight Low-Rank Projection (WeLore) that unifies weight compression and memory-efficient fine-tuning as ONE, in a data-agnostic and one-shot way. WeLore capitalizes the heavy-tail distribution of singular values to identify a suitable rank reduction ratio for matrices within LLMs. Going beyond only as a compression technique, WeLore categorizes weight matrices into Low-rank Components (LRCs) and Non-Low-rank Components (N-LRCs) based on their ability to express themselves as low-rank. The gradient perspective and extensive experiments illustrate that LRCs tend to have better finetuning capabilities and can closely mimic (sometimes outperform) the training loss trajectory and performance of full-finetuning with notable memory and compute footprint reduction. For example, finetuning a 50% compressed LLaMa-2 7B model using only a fraction of parameters in LRCs (WeLore) can outperform its full finetuning with ~3x better throughput and ~0.6x GPU requirement.

33. ***Practical Unlearning for Large Language Models: <br>
Addressing security issues in LLMs, the O3 framework provides a solution for machine unlearning without compromising model utility. It includes an OOD detector and an Orthogonal LoRA for continuous unlearning. O3 smartly decides on unlearning actions during inference and shows superior performance across various tasks and datasets, especially with continuous unlearning requests.*** <br>
    Jul 14, Northwestern Uni and Arizona State Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10223) “Practical Unlearning for Large Language Models”. While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance across various domains and tasks, their security issues have become increasingly severe. Machine unlearning (MU) has emerged as a promising solution to address these issues by removing the influence of undesired data on the target model without compromising its utility in other aspects. MU typically assumes full access to the original training data to preserve utility, which is difficult to achieve in LLM unlearning. Existing LLM unlearning methods often assume access to data most affected by undesired data unlearning. However, this assumption underestimates the entanglement among various LLM capabilities and ignores data access limitations due to various issues. Moreover, these LLM unlearning methods do not sufficiently consider that unlearning requests in real-world scenarios are continuously emerging. To overcome these challenges and achieve practical LLM unlearning, the authors propose the O3 framework. The O3 framework includes an Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detector to measure the similarity between input and unlearning data, and an Orthogonal low-rank adapter (LoRA) for continuously unlearning requested data. The OOD detector is trained with a novel contrastive entropy loss and utilizes a local-global layer-aggregated scoring mechanism. The orthogonal LoRA achieves parameter disentanglement among continual unlearning requests. During inference, the O3 framework can smartly decide whether and to what extent to load the unlearning LoRA based on the OOD detector's predictions. Notably, O3's effectiveness does not rely on any retained data. The authors conducted extensive experiments on O3 and state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods across three tasks and seven datasets. The results indicate that O3 consistently achieves the best trade-off between unlearning effectiveness and utility preservation, especially when facing continuous unlearning requests. <br><br>

35. ***Vocabulary used by ChatGPT in academic writing:  <br>
The paper examines LLM usage in academic writing, identifying a significant impact on scientific literature. By analyzing vocabulary changes in PubMed abstracts, the study estimates that at least 10% of 2024 abstracts involved LLMs. This impact varies across disciplines and regions, with notable increases in certain fields. The study highlights the widespread adoption of LLMs in academia.*** <br>
    Jul 3, researchers from Uni of Tubingen and Northwestern Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.07016) “Delving into ChatGPT usage in academic writing through excess vocabulary”. Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate and revise text with human-level performance, and have been widely commercialized in systems like ChatGPT. These models come with clear limitations: they can produce inaccurate information, reinforce existing biases, and be easily misused. Yet, many scientists have been using them to assist their scholarly writing. How wide-spread is LLM usage in the academic literature currently? To answer this question, the work uses an unbiased, large-scale approach, free from any assumptions on academic LLM usage. The authors study vocabulary changes in 14 million PubMed abstracts from 2010-2024, and show how the appearance of LLMs led to an abrupt increase in the frequency of certain style words. The analysis based on excess words usage suggests that at least 10% of 2024 abstracts were processed with LLMs. This lower bound differed across disciplines, countries, and journals, and was as high as 30% for some PubMed sub-corpora. The paper shows that the appearance of LLM-based writing assistants has had an unprecedented impact in the scientific literature, surpassing the effect of major world events such as the Covid pandemic. The paper also shows the six most widely used words by ChatGPT: delves, crucial, potential, these, significant, and important. <br><br>

37. ***Self-replicating Programs Emerge from Simple Interaction: <br>
The study explores how self-replicating programs arise from simple computational interactions. It demonstrates that self-replicators emerge in environments without explicit fitness landscapes due to random interactions and self-modification. The findings contribute to understanding the dynamics of self-replication and complex behavior emergence in computational substrates.*** <br>
    Jun 27, Google and Uni of Chicago published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19108) “Computational Life: How Well-formed, Self-replicating Programs Emerge from Simple Interaction”. The fields of Origin of Life and Artificial Life both question what life is and how it emerges from a distinct set of "pre-life" dynamics. One common feature of most substrates where life emerges is a marked shift in dynamics when self-replication appears. While there are some hypotheses regarding how self-replicators arose in nature, people know very little about the general dynamics, computational principles, and necessary conditions for self-replicators to emerge. This is especially true on "computational substrates" where interactions involve logical, mathematical, or programming rules. This paper takes a step towards understanding how self-replicators arise by studying several computational substrates based on various simple programming languages and machine instruction sets. The authors show that when random, non self-replicating programs are placed in an environment lacking any explicit fitness landscape, self-replicators tend to arise. The study demonstrates how this occurs due to random interactions and self-modification, and can happen with and without background random mutations. The paper also shows how increasingly complex dynamics continue to emerge following the rise of self-replicators. Finally, the authors show a counterexample of a minimalistic programming language where self-replicators are possible, but so far have not been observed to arise.
