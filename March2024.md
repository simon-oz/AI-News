1. ***LISA: Layerwise Importance Sampling for Memory-Efficient Large Language Model Fine-Tuning <br>
   Researchers from HKUST and UIUC introduce LISA, a novel fine-tuning technique for large language models (LLMs) addressing memory inefficiency. LISA leverages layerwise properties of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and importance sampling to reduce memory costs while maintaining performance. Experimental results demonstrate LISA's superiority over LoRA and full parameter tuning in various fine-tuning tasks, even outperforming LoRA by over 11%-37%.*** <br><br>
   29 Mar, HKUST and UIUC published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17919) ‚ÄúLISA: Layerwise Importance Sampling for Memory-Efficient Large Language Model Fine-Tuning‚Äù. The paper states that the machine learning community has witnessed impressive advancements since the first appearance of large language models (LLMs), yet their huge memory consumption has become a major roadblock to large-scale training. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been proposed to alleviate this problem, but their performance still fails to match full parameter training in most large-scale fine-tuning settings. Attempting to complement this deficiency, the study investigates layerwise properties of LoRA on fine-tuning tasks and observes an uncommon skewness of weight norms across different layers. Utilizing this key observation, a surprisingly simple training strategy is discovered, which outperforms both LoRA and full parameter training in a wide range of settings with memory costs as low as LoRA. The authors name it Layerwise Importance Sampled AdamW (LISA), a promising alternative for LoRA, which applies the idea of importance sampling to different layers in LLMs and randomly freeze most middle layers during optimization. Experimental results show that with similar or less GPU memory consumption, LISA surpasses LoRA or even full parameter tuning in downstream fine-tuning tasks, where LISA consistently outperforms LoRA by over 11%-37% in terms of MT-Bench scores. On large models, specifically LLaMA-2-70B, LISA achieves on-par or better performance than LoRA on MT-Bench, GSM8K, and PubMedQA, demonstrating its effectiveness across different domains.

The paper develops a data-driven approach to collect and analyse tasks that users are asking to generative LLMs. Thanks to the focus on tasks this paper contributes to give a quantitative and granular understanding of the potential influence of LLMs in different business areas. Utilizing a dataset comprising over 3.8 million tweets, the authors identify and cluster 31,747 unique tasks, with a specific case study on ChatGPT. To reach this goal, the proposed method combines two Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques, Named Entity Recognition (NER) and BERTopic. The combination makes it possible to collect granular tasks of LLMs (NER) and clusters them in business areas (BERTopic). The findings reveal a wide spectrum of applications, from programming assistance to creative content generation, highlighting LLM's versatility. The analysis highlighted six emerging areas of application for ChatGPT: human resources, programming, social media, office automation, search engines, education. The study also examines the implications of these findings for innovation management, proposing a research agenda to explore the intersection of the identified areas, with four stages of the innovation process: idea generation, screening/idea selection, development, and diffusion/sales/marketing.

The model aims to improve user experience and efficiency in tasks requiring advanced reasoning and understanding of long contextual information.*** <br><br>
   28 Mar, [XAI announced Grok-1.5](https://x.ai/blog/grok-1.5), the latest model capable of long context understanding and advanced reasoning. Grok-1.5 will be available to our early testers and existing Grok users on the ùïè platform in the coming days. One of the most notable improvements in Grok-1.5 is its performance in coding and math-related tasks. Tests show that Grok-1.5 achieved a 50.6% score on the MATH benchmark and a 90% score on the GSM8K benchmark, two math benchmarks covering a wide range of grade school to high school competition problems. Additionally, it scored 74.1% on the HumanEval benchmark, which evaluates code generation and problem-solving abilities. A new feature in Grok-1.5 is the capability to process long contexts of up to 128K tokens within its context window. This allows Grok to have an increased memory capacity of up to 16 times the previous context length, enabling it to utilize information from substantially longer documents. Furthermore, the model can handle longer and more complex prompts, while still maintaining its instruction-following capability as its context window expands. In the Needle In A Haystack (NIAH) evaluation, Grok-1.5 demonstrated powerful retrieval capabilities for embedded text within contexts of up to 128K tokens in length, achieving perfect retrieval results. Grok-1.5 will soon be available to early testers, and XAI looks forward to receiving users' feedback to help it improve Grok.

5. ***MagicLens: Self-Supervised Image Retrieval with Open-Ended Instructions <br>
   Google presents MagicLens, a series of self-supervised image retrieval models supporting open-ended instructions. MagicLens leverages large multimodal models to retrieve images with rich relations beyond visual similarity, achieving superior results on various benchmarks. The model's novel approach synthesizes instructions to reveal implicit relations in image pairs, demonstrating improved performance with smaller model sizes.*** <br><br>
    28 Mar, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19651) ‚ÄúMagicLens: Self-Supervised Image Retrieval with Open-Ended Instructions‚Äù. The paper indicates that image retrieval, i.e., finding desired images given a reference image, inherently encompasses rich, multi-faceted search intents that are difficult to capture solely using image-based measures. Recent work leverages text instructions to allow users to more freely express their search intents. However, existing work primarily focuses on image pairs that are visually similar and/or can be characterized by a small set of pre-defined relations. The core thesis of this paper is that text instructions can enable retrieving images with richer relations beyond visual similarity. To show this, the study introduces MagicLens, a series of self-supervised image retrieval models that support open-ended instructions. MagicLens is built on a key novel insight: image pairs that naturally occur on the same web pages contain a wide range of implicit relations (e.g., inside view of), and the research can bring those implicit relations explicit by synthesizing instructions via large multimodal models (LMMs) and large language models (LLMs). Trained on 36.7M (query image, instruction, target image) triplets with rich semantic relations mined from the web, MagicLens achieves comparable or better results on eight benchmarks of various image retrieval tasks than prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Remarkably, it outperforms previous SOTA but with a 50X smaller model size on multiple benchmarks. Additional human analyses on a 1.4M-image unseen corpus further demonstrate the diversity of search intents supported by MagicLens.

6. ***ROUTER BENCH: Benchmark for Multi-LLM Routing System <br>
   UC Berkeley and UCSD introduce RouterBench, an evaluation framework for assessing the efficacy of multi-LLM routing systems. RouterBench provides a standardized benchmark and dataset for evaluating routing strategies, facilitating the development of more effective LLM routing solutions. The study highlights the potentials and limitations of various routing approaches, contributing to the advancement of LLM routing systems.*** <br><br>
    28 Mar, UC Berkeley and UCSD published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12031v1) ‚ÄúROUTER B ENCH: A Benchmark for Multi-LLM Routing System‚Äù. The paper finds that as the range of applications for Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to grow, the demand for effective serving solutions becomes increasingly critical. Despite the versatility of LLMs, no single model can optimally address all tasks and applications, particularly when balancing performance with cost. This limitation has led to the development of LLM routing systems, which combine the strengths of various models to overcome the constraints of individual LLMs. Yet, the absence of a standardized benchmark for evaluating the performance of LLM routers hinders progress in this area. To bridge this gap, the study presents RouterBench, a novel evaluation framework designed to systematically assess the efficacy of LLM routing systems, along with a comprehensive dataset comprising over 405k inference outcomes from representative LLMs to support the development of routing strategies. The authors further propose a theoretical framework for LLM routing, and deliver a comparative analysis of various routing approaches through RouterBench, highlighting their potentials and limitations within the evaluation framework. This work not only formalizes and advances the development of LLM routing systems but also sets a standard for their assessment, paving the way for more accessible and economically viable LLM deployments. The code and data are available at https://github.com/withmartian/routerbench.
 
7. ***Long-Form Factuality in Large Language Models <br>
   Google presents a study on long-form factuality in large language models, proposing a method for evaluating factuality in open domains. The study introduces LongFact, a prompt set for evaluating long-form factuality, and develops a method called Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator (SAFE) to assess factuality. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of SAFE in evaluating factuality, with LLM agents achieving superhuman performance in rating factuality.*** <br><br>
    27 Mar, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18802) ‚ÄúLong-form factuality in large language models‚Äù. The authors observed that Large language models (LLMs) often generate content that contains factual errors when responding to fact-seeking prompts on open-ended topics. To benchmark a model's long-form factuality in open domains, the authors first use GPT-4 to generate LongFact, a prompt set comprising thousands of questions spanning 38 topics. The authors then propose that LLM agents can be used as automated evaluators for long-form factuality through a method which is called Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator (SAFE). SAFE utilizes an LLM to break down a long-form response into a set of individual facts and to evaluate the accuracy of each fact using a multi-step reasoning process comprising sending search queries to Google Search and determining whether a fact is supported by the search results. Furthermore, the study proposes extending F1 score as an aggregated metric for long-form factuality. To do so, the authors balance the percentage of supported facts in a response (precision) with the percentage of provided facts relative to a hyperparameter representing a user's preferred response length (recall). Empirically, the paper demonstrates that LLM agents can achieve superhuman rating performance - on a set of ~16k individual facts, SAFE agrees with crowdsourced human annotators 72% of the time, and on a random subset of 100 disagreement cases, SAFE wins 76% of the time. At the same time, SAFE is more than 20 times cheaper than human annotators. The authors also benchmark thirteen language models on LongFact across four model families (Gemini, GPT, Claude, and PaLM-2), finding that larger language models generally achieve better long-form factuality. LongFact, SAFE, and all experimental code are available at [this https URL](https://github.com/google-deepmind/long-form-factuality).

8. ***DBRX: New Standard for Efficient Open Source LLMs <br>
   Databricks announces DBRX, a general-purpose large language model outperforming established open-source models on standard benchmarks. DBRX offers superior performance and efficiency compared to other models, including GPT-3.5, and is built on the MegaBlocks research project. The model's Mixture-of-Experts architecture and optimized training libraries contribute to its scalability and performance in various AI applications.*** <br><br>
    27 Mar, [Databricks announced DBRX](https://www.databricks.com/blog/announcing-dbrx-new-standard-efficient-open-source-customizable-llms), A new standard for efficient open source LLMs. DBRX is a general purpose large language model (LLM) built by Mosaic Research team that outperforms all established open source models on standard benchmarks. Databricks believes that pushing the boundary of open source models enables generative AI for all enterprises that is customizable and transparent. First, DBRX handily beats open source models, such as, LLaMA2-70B, Mixtral, and Grok-1 on language understanding, programming, math, and logic. Second, DBRX beats GPT-3.5 on most benchmarks. Third, DBRX is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model built on the MegaBlocks research and open source project, making the model extremely fast in terms of tokens/second. DBRX uses only 36 billion parameters at any given time. But the model itself is 132 billion parameters. The aforementioned three reasons lead Databricks to believe that open source LLMs will continue gaining momentum. In particular, open source LLMs provide an exciting opportunity for organizations to customize open source LLMs that can become their IP, which they use to be competitive in their industry. Human feedback for quality and safety was collected through Mosaic AI Model Serving and Inference Tables. Customers and partners such as JetBlue, Block, NASDAQ, and Accenture are already using these same tools to build high quality AI systems. DBRX was trained on 3072 NVIDIA H100s connected by 3.2Tbps Infiniband. Databricks processed and cleaned this data using Apache Spark‚Ñ¢ and Databricks notebooks. DBRX was trained by using optimized versions of our open-source training libraries: MegaBlocks, LLM Foundry, Composer, and Streaming. Databricks managed large scale model training and finetuning across thousands of GPUs using Mosaic AI Training service. Experimental results was logged by using MLflow. Human feedback was collected for quality and safety improvements through Mosaic AI Model Serving and Inference Tables. Databricks manually experimented with the model using the Databricks Playground.

9. ***Improving Text-to-Image Consistency via Automatic Prompt Optimization <br>
   Meta and Uni Montreal et al. introduce OPT2I, a framework leveraging large language models to improve text-to-image consistency. OPT2I optimizes prompt-image consistency through iterative prompt optimization, enhancing performance on diverse datasets. The framework aims to build more reliable and robust text-to-image systems by harnessing the power of large language models.*** <br><br>
    27 Mar, Meta and Uni Montreal et al published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17804) ‚ÄúImproving Text-to-Image Consistency via Automatic Prompt Optimization‚Äù. The paper states that impressive advances in text-to-image (T2I) generative models have yielded a plethora of high performing models which are able to generate aesthetically appealing, photorealistic images. Despite the progress, these models still struggle to produce images that are consistent with the input prompt, oftentimes failing to capture object quantities, relations and attributes properly. Existing solutions to improve prompt-image consistency suffer from the following challenges: (1) they oftentimes require model fine-tuning, (2) they only focus on nearby prompt samples, and (3) they are affected by unfavorable trade-offs among image quality, representation diversity, and prompt-image consistency. This paper addresses these challenges and introduce a T2I optimization-by-prompting framework, OPT2I, which leverages a large language model (LLM) to improve prompt-image consistency in T2I models. The framework starts from a user prompt and iteratively generates revised prompts with the goal of maximizing a consistency score. The extensive validation on two datasets, MSCOCO and PartiPrompts, shows that OPT2I can boost the initial consistency score by up to 24.9% in terms of DSG score while preserving the FID and increasing the recall between generated and real data. This work paves the way toward building more reliable and robust T2I systems by harnessing the power of LLMs.

10. ***The Role of Computational Science in Digital Twins<br>
   UTA and NASEM discuss the role of computational science in enabling digital twin technologies for scientific discovery and innovation. The paper identifies key research opportunities and challenges in computational sciences for advancing digital twin technologies across multiple domains. It emphasizes the importance of integrated research agendas and collaborations to realize the potential benefits of digital twins in various fields.*** <br><br>
    26 Mar, UTA and NASEM published a [blog](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-024-00609-4) on Nature Computational Science, ‚ÄúThe role of computational science in digital twins‚Äù. The paper indicates that digital twins hold immense promise in accelerating scientific discovery, but the publicity currently outweighs the evidence base of success. The authors summarize key research opportunities in the computational sciences to enable digital twin technologies, as identified by a recent National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine consensus study report. Digital twins are emerging as enablers for significant, sustainable progress across multiple domains of science, engineering, and medicine. However, realizing these benefits requires a sustained and holistic commitment to an integrated research agenda that addresses foundational challenges across mathematics, statistics, and computing. Within the virtual representation, advancing the models themselves is necessarily domain specific, but advancing the hybrid modeling and surrogate modeling embodies shared challenges that crosscut domains. Similarly, many of the physical counterpart challenges around sensor technologies and data are domain specific, but issues around fusing multimodal data, data interoperability, and advancing data curation practices embody shared challenges that crosscut domains. When it comes to the bidirectional flows, dedicated efforts are needed to advance data assimilation, inverse methods, control, and sensor-steering methodologies that are applicable across domains, while at the same time recognizing the domain-specific nature of decision making. Finally, there is substantial opportunity to develop innovative digital twin VVUQ methods that translate across domains.

11. ***The Unreasonable Ineffectiveness of the Deeper Layers<br>
   Meta, MIT, and Zephyr empirically study layer pruning strategies for pretrained LLMs, revealing minimal performance degradation after pruning. The study suggests that layer pruning methods can complement parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies, reducing computational resources without significant loss in performance. Results indicate that deeper layers in LLMs may not be effectively utilized in current pretraining methods, suggesting potential improvements in leveraging network parameters.*** <br><br>
    26 Mar, Meta, MIT and Zephyr published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17887) ‚ÄúThe Unreasonable Ineffectiveness of the Deeper Layers‚Äù. The authors empirically study a simple layer-pruning strategy for popular families of open-weight pretrained LLMs, finding minimal degradation of performance on different question-answering benchmarks until after a large fraction (up to half) of the layers are removed. To prune these models, the study identifies the optimal block of layers to prune by considering similarity across layers; then, to "heal" the damage, the study performs a small amount of finetuning. In particular, the research uses parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods, specifically quantization and Low Rank Adapters (QLoRA), such that each of the experiments can be performed on a single A100 GPU. From a practical perspective, these results suggest that layer pruning methods can complement other PEFT strategies to further reduce computational resources of finetuning on the one hand, and can improve the memory and latency of inference on the other hand. From a scientific perspective, the robustness of these LLMs to the deletion of layers implies either that current pretraining methods are not properly leveraging the parameters in the deeper layers of the network or that the shallow layers play a critical role in storing knowledge.

12. ***AgentStudio: A Toolkit for Building General Virtual Agents<br>
   NTU Singapore and ETH introduce AgentStudio, a toolkit for developing general virtual agents capable of using arbitrary software on digital devices. AgentStudio covers the entire lifecycle of agent development, providing environments, data collection, evaluation, and visualization tools. The toolkit enables the creation of versatile virtual agents for various applications, promoting research towards developing general virtual agents for the future.*** <br><br>
    26 Mar, NTU Singapore and ETH published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17918) ‚ÄúAgentStudio: A Toolkit for Building General Virtual Agents‚Äù. The paper states that creating autonomous virtual agents capable of using arbitrary software on any digital device remains a major challenge for artificial intelligence. Two key obstacles hinder progress: insufficient infrastructure for building virtual agents in real-world environments, and the need for in-the-wild evaluation of fundamental agent abilities. To address this, the paper introduces AgentStudio, an online, realistic, and multimodal toolkit that covers the entire lifecycle of agent development. This includes environment setups, data collection, agent evaluation, and visualization. The observation and action spaces are highly generic, supporting both function calling and human-computer interfaces. This versatility is further enhanced by AgentStudio's graphical user interfaces, which allow efficient development of datasets and benchmarks in real-world settings. To illustrate, the study introduces a visual grounding dataset and a real-world benchmark suite, both created with graphical interfaces. Furthermore, the paper presents several actionable insights derived from AgentStudio, e.g., general visual grounding, open-ended tool creation, learning from videos, etc. The authors have [open-sourced](https://skyworkai.github.io/agent-studio/index.html) the environments, datasets, benchmarks, and interfaces to promote research towards developing general virtual agents for the future.

13. ***EU Investigates Tech Giants for Uncompetitive Practices<br>
   The EU announces investigations into major tech firms, including Meta, Apple, and Alphabet, for potential breaches of the Digital Markets Act. The investigations focus on alleged non-compliance with regulations related to app communication, user choice, data privacy, and search result preferences. The cases highlight growing concerns over the market dominance and practices of large tech companies, prompting regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions.*** <br><br>
    25 Mar, [according to BBC](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Ftechnology-68655093&data=05%7C02%7Cd.zhu%40curtin.edu.au%7C0c401f7033fe4cb99a1d08dc4e4bee67%7C5a740cd757684d09ae13f706b09fa22c%7C0%7C0%7C638471335226257392%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=wLPB%2BSPNWBFNkoCvLv7jpivy3gm52QE%2FtQQEH9TeHnE%3D&reserved=0), The EU has announced investigations into some of the biggest tech firms in the world over uncompetitive practices. Meta, Apple, and Alphabet, which owns Google, are being looked into for potential breaches of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) introduced in 2022. If they are found to have broken the rules, the firms can face huge fines of up to 10% of their annual turnover. EU antitrust boss Margrethe Vestager and industry head Thierry Breton announced the investigations on Monday. Just six companies have obligations under the DMA, but they are also the world's largest tech firms: Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and ByteDance. None of the firms are actually based in Europe - five of them are in the US, while ByteDance has headquarters in Beijing. Three of them are now facing questions just two weeks after submitting their compliance reports, which will have been meticulously compiled. It comes three weeks after the EU fined Apple ‚Ç¨1.8bn (¬£1.5bn) for breaking competition laws over music streaming. Meanwhile, the United States accused Apple of monopolising the smartphone market in a landmark lawsuit against the tech giant introduced last week. The EU said it will investigate five different possible acts of non-compliance in its announcement: 1) 1 & 2 - Whether Apple and Alphabet are not allowing apps to freely communicate with users and make contracts with them 2) 3 - Whether Apple is not giving users enough choice 3) 4 - Whether Meta is unfairly asking people to pay to avoid their data being used for adverts 4)5 - Whether Google preferences the firm's own goods and services in search results. The five cases are consumer-focused, and highly relatable to most people who use products from these companies, which is collectively billions of people worldwide.

14. ***Study Links ChatGPT Usage to Declining Academic Performance<br>
   PsyPost reports on a study examining the causes and consequences of ChatGPT usage among university students, suggesting potential negative effects on academic performance. The study finds correlations between ChatGPT usage and procrastination, memory loss, and decreased academic performance among students. Results indicate the importance of understanding the impacts of generative AI usage on student behavior and academic outcomes.*** <br><br>
    25 Mar, [according to PsyPost](https://www.psypost.org/chatgpt-linked-to-declining-academic-performance-and-memory-loss-in-new-study/), ChatGPT linked to declining academic performance and memory loss in new study. This post is based on paper ‚ÄúIs it harmful or helpful? Examining the causes and consequences of generative AI usage among university students‚Äù published on International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education. The paper states that while the discussion on generative artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT, is making waves in academia and the popular press, there is a need for more insight into the use of ChatGPT among students and the potential harmful or beneficial consequences associated with its usage. Using samples from two studies, the current research examined the causes and consequences of ChatGPT usage among university students. Study 1 developed and validated an eight-item scale to measure ChatGPT usage by conducting a survey among university students (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ165). Study 2 used a three-wave time-lagged design to collect data from university students (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ494) to further validate the scale and test the study‚Äôs hypotheses. Study 2 also examined the effects of academic workload, academic time pressure, sensitivity to rewards, and sensitivity to quality on ChatGPT usage. Study 2 further examined the effects of ChatGPT usage on students‚Äô levels of procrastination, memory loss, and academic performance. Study 1 provided evidence for the validity and reliability of the ChatGPT usage scale. Furthermore, study 2 revealed that when students faced higher academic workload and time pressure, they were more likely to use ChatGPT. In contrast, students who were sensitive to rewards were less likely to use ChatGPT. Not surprisingly, use of ChatGPT was likely to develop tendencies for procrastination and memory loss and dampen the students‚Äô academic performance. Finally, academic workload, time pressure, and sensitivity to rewards had indirect effects on students‚Äô outcomes through ChatGPT usage.

15. ***AIOS: LLM Agent Operating System<br>
   Rutgers University presents AIOS, an LLM agent operating system addressing challenges in deploying LLM-based intelligent agents. It tackles issues like scheduling, context maintenance, and agent integration, aiming to optimize resource allocation, facilitate context switch, and enable concurrent execution. Experiments demonstrate AIOS's reliability and efficiency, fostering better development and deployment of the AIOS ecosystem in the future. The project is open-source.*** <br><br>
    25 Mar, Rutgers University published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16971) ‚ÄúAIOS: LLM Agent Operating System‚Äù. The paper states that the integration and deployment of large language model (LLM)-based intelligent agents have been fraught with challenges that compromise their efficiency and efficacy. Among these issues are sub-optimal scheduling and resource allocation of agent requests over the LLM, the difficulties in maintaining context during interactions between agent and LLM, and the complexities inherent in integrating heterogeneous agents with different capabilities and specializations. The rapid increase of agent quantity and complexity further exacerbates these issues, often leading to bottlenecks and sub-optimal utilization of resources. Inspired by these challenges, this paper presents AIOS, an LLM agent operating system, which embeds a large language model into operating systems (OS) as the brain of the OS, enabling an operating system "with soul" -- an important step towards AGI. Specifically, AIOS is designed to optimize resource allocation, facilitate context switch across agents, enable concurrent execution of agents, provide tool service for agents, and maintain access control for agents. The authors present the architecture of such an operating system, outline the core challenges it aims to resolve, and provide the basic design and implementation of the AIOS. The experiments on concurrent execution of multiple agents demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of the AIOS modules. Through this, the researchers aim to not only improve the performance and efficiency of LLM agents but also to pioneer for better development and deployment of the AIOS ecosystem in the future. The project is open-source at [this https URL](https://github.com/agiresearch/AIOS).

16. ***A Collective AI via Lifelong Learning and Sharing at the Edge<br>
   Loughborough University discusses a vision of collective AI where units learn independently and share knowledge. Key aspects include lifelong learning, knowledge exchange, local data use, and decentralized computation. The paper reviews recent advances converging towards collective machine-learned intelligence, predicting the emergence of scalable, resilient, and sustainable AI systems.*** <br><br>
    22 Mar, Natural Machine Intelligence published a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00800-2) by Loughborough University, ‚ÄúA collective AI via lifelong learning and sharing at the edge‚Äù. The paper argues that one vision of a future artificial intelligence (AI) is where many separate units can learn independently over a lifetime and share their knowledge with each other. The synergy between lifelong learning and sharing has the potential to create a society of AI systems, as each individual unit can contribute to and benefit from the collective knowledge. Essential to this vision are the abilities to learn multiple skills incrementally during a lifetime, to exchange knowledge among units via a common language, to use both local data and communication to learn, and to rely on edge devices to host the necessary decentralized computation and data. The result is a network of agents that can quickly respond to and learn new tasks, that collectively hold more knowledge than a single agent and that can extend current knowledge in more diverse ways than a single agent. Open research questions include when and what knowledge should be shared to maximize both the rate of learning and the long-term learning performance. Here the authors review recent machine learning advances converging towards creating a collective machine-learned intelligence. The paper proposes that the convergence of such scientific and technological advances will lead to the emergence of new types of scalable, resilient and sustainable AI systems. ‚ÄúRecent research trends are extending AI models with the ability to continuously adapt once deployed, and make their knowledge reusable by other models, effectively recycling knowledge to optimise learning speed and energy demands,‚Äù Dr. Soltoggio said.  ‚ÄúWe believe that the current dominating large, expensive, non-shareable and non-lifelong AI models will not survive in a future where sustainable, evolving, and sharing collective of AI units are likely to emerge.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe believe similar dynamics are likely to occur in future societies of AI units that will implement democratic and collaborating collectives.‚Äù

   Microsoft introduces AllHands, an analytic framework leveraging LLMs for large-scale feedback analysis. AllHands employs classification, topic modeling, and an LLM agent to interpret natural language queries, providing comprehensive responses. Evaluation across diverse datasets shows superior efficacy, offering a natural language interface for insight extraction from feedback.*** <br><br>
    22 Mar, Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15157) ‚ÄúAllHands: Ask Me Anything on Large-scale Verbatim Feedback via Large Language Models‚Äù. The paper indicates that verbatim feedback constitutes a valuable repository of user experiences, opinions, and requirements essential for software development. Effectively and efficiently extracting valuable insights from such data poses a challenging task. This paper introduces Allhands , an innovative analytic framework designed for large-scale feedback analysis through a natural language interface, leveraging large language models (LLMs). Allhands adheres to a conventional feedback analytic workflow, initially conducting classification and topic modeling on the feedback to convert them into a structurally augmented format, incorporating LLMs to enhance accuracy, robustness, generalization, and user-friendliness. Subsequently, an LLM agent is employed to interpret users' diverse questions in natural language on feedback, translating them into Python code for execution, and delivering comprehensive multi-modal responses, including text, code, tables, and images. The authors evaluate Allhands across three diverse feedback datasets. The experiments demonstrate that Allhands achieves superior efficacy at all stages of analysis, including classification and topic modeling, eventually providing users with an ‚Äúask me anything‚Äù experience with comprehensive, correct and human-readable response. Allhands stands as the first comprehensive feedback analysis framework that supports diverse and customized requirements for insight extraction through a natural language interface.

   HippocraticAI presents Polaris, a safety-focused LLM constellation for real-time patient-AI healthcare conversations. It employs a one-trillion parameter constellation system with a primary agent and specialist support agents trained on diverse medical data. Polaris undergoes comprehensive clinician evaluation, performing comparably to human nurses across various dimensions and outperforming larger LLM models in specific tasks.***  <br><br>
    20 Mar, HippocraticAI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13313) ‚ÄúPolaris: A Safety-focused LLM Constellation Architecture for Healthcare‚Äù to introduce its Polaris LLM for healthcare system. Polaris is the first safety-focused LLM constellation for real-time patient-AI healthcare conversations. Unlike prior LLM works in healthcare focusing on tasks like question answering, Polaris specifically focuses on long multi-turn voice conversations. Polaris‚Äôs one-trillion parameter constellation system is composed of several multibillion parameter LLMs as co-operative agents: a stateful primary agent that focuses on driving an engaging conversation and several specialist support agents focused on healthcare tasks performed by nurses to increase safety and reduce hallucinations. The researchers develop a sophisticated training protocol for iterative co-training of the agents that optimize for diverse objectives. The models are trained on proprietary data, clinical care plans, healthcare regulatory documents, medical manuals, and other medical reasoning documents. The models are aligned to speak like medical professionals, using organic healthcare conversations and simulated ones between patient actors and experienced nurses. This allows Solaris to express unique capabilities such as rapport building, trust building, empathy and bedside manner. Finally, the paper presents the first comprehensive clinician evaluation of an LLM system for healthcare. The authors recruited over 1100 U.S. licensed nurses and over 130 U.S. licensed physicians to perform end-to-end conversational evaluations of Solaris by posing as patients and rating the system on several measures. The study demonstrates Polaris performs on par with human nurses on aggregate across dimensions such as medical safety, clinical readiness, conversational quality, and bedside manner. Additionally, the authors conduct a challenging task-based evaluation of the individual specialist support agents, and demonstrate the LLM agents significantly outperform a much larger general-purpose LLM (GPT-4) as well as from its own medium-size class (LLaMA-2 70B).  <br> <br> <br>

2. ***AI Flood Forecasting Advancements <br>
   A study published in Nature reveals the effectiveness of AI-based forecasting in predicting extreme floods, particularly in areas lacking streamflow gauge networks. The research demonstrates the reliability of AI in predicting floods up to a five-day lead time, surpassing current methods. This highlights the importance of increasing hydrological data availability for better flood warnings globally.***  <br><br>
  20 Mar, Nature published a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07145-1.pdf) from Google and other institutes ‚ÄúGlobal prediction of extreme floods in ungauged watersheds‚Äù. The paper finds that floods are one of the most common natural disasters, with a disproportionate impact in developing countries that often lack dense streamflow gauge networks1. Accurate and timely warnings are critical for mitigating flood risks2, but hydrological simulation models typically must be calibrated to long data records in each watershed. The paper shows that artificial intelligence-based forecasting achieves reliability in predicting extreme riverine events in ungauged watersheds at up to a five-day lead time that is similar to or better than the reliability of nowcasts (zero-day lead time) from a current state-of-the-art global modelling system (the Copernicus Emergency Management Service Global Flood Awareness System). In addition, the study achieves accuracies over five-year return period events that are similar to or better than current accuracies over one-year return period events. This means that artificial intelligence can provide flood warnings earlier and over larger and more impactful events in ungauged basins. The model developed here was incorporated into an operational early warning system that produces publicly available (free and open) forecasts in real time in over 80 countries. This work highlights a need for increasing the availability of hydrological data to continue to improve global access to reliable flood warnings.

3.	***Google Fined in France for Breach <br>
   Google faces a ‚Ç¨270 million fine in France for breaching commitments with news publishers, including using their content without proper notification for training its AI model Bard/Gemini. The competition authority also criticizes Google for failing to provide necessary information to publishers during negotiations. Google agrees to the fine and commits to improving its practices.*** <br><br>
   20 Mar, according to [techcrunch.com](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/20/google-hit-with-270m-fine-in-france-as-authority-finds-news-publishers-data-was-used-for-gemini/), Google hit with $270M fine in France as authority finds news publishers‚Äô data was used for Gemini. According to the competition watchdog, Google disregarded some of its previous commitments with news publishers. But the decision is especially notable because it drops something else that‚Äôs bang up-to-date ‚Äî by latching onto Google‚Äôs use of news publishers‚Äô content to train its generative AI model Bard/Gemini. The competition authority has found fault with Google for failing to notify news publishers of this GenAI use of their copyrighted content. This is in light of earlier commitments Google made which are aimed at ensuring it undertakes fair payment talks with publishers over reuse of their content. Google has agreed not to contest the Autorit√©‚Äôs latest findings ‚Äî in exchange for a fast-tracked process and making a monetary payment. The Autorit√© is also sanctioning Google for a raft of other issues related to how it negotiates with French news publishers, finding it failed to provide them with all the information needed to ensure fair bargaining of remuneration for their content. It also said Google failed to act on its commitment to update remuneration contracts in line with its pledges.

4. ***Challenges of AI Watermarking <br>
   Despite efforts from major tech companies to implement watermarking standards to combat AI-driven misinformation, challenges remain in ensuring its effectiveness. Watermarking can be bypassed, posing doubts about its reliability, especially in identifying and mitigating deepfakes. Educating the public about recognizing watermarks is crucial but challenging.*** <br><br>
   20 Mar, [according to CNBC](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Ftech%2Ftech-news%2Fwatermark-deepfake-solution-ai-misinformation-cant-stop-de-rcna137370&data=05%7C02%7Cd.zhu%40curtin.edu.au%7Cb99735b3f459486e50d108dc48a4b52d%7C5a740cd757684d09ae13f706b09fa22c%7C0%7C0%7C638465119454526817%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=fXrHzQ95GevYJd6vP4cJR5U%2B9jkcDhVmlf%2FdPZ9W6ZE%3D&reserved=0), Big Tech says AI watermarks could curb misinformation, but they're easy to sidestep. Big Tech companies have agreed to watermarking standards as a potential solution to combat AI-driven misinformation online. However, those who misuse technology to deceive others are not adhering to these standards. Watermarking involves embedding invisible tags or visible labels into media, but it has proven to be easily bypassed, raising doubts about its effectiveness. Despite efforts from companies like Meta, Google, and Microsoft to implement watermarking, challenges remain in ensuring its reliability, particularly in identifying and mitigating deepfakes, which continue to pose significant threats, including in political disinformation campaigns and scams. Educating the public to recognize watermarks and verify media authenticity may be crucial for the success of such initiatives, but achieving widespread awareness poses significant challenges.

5.	***Huggingface Releases Common Corpus <br>

CC aims to support open science in AI training while providing diverse and reproducible datasets. It includes multilingual content and is intended to enhance accessibility and diversity in AI research.***  <br><br>
    20 Mar, [Huggingface released](https://huggingface.co/blog/Pclanglais/common-corpus) Common Corpus (CC), largest public domain dataset for training LLMs. CC is an international initiative coordinated by Pleias, involving researchers in LLM pretraining, AI ethics and cultural heritage like, in association with major organizations committed to an open science approach for AI (HuggingFace, Occiglot, Eleuther, Nomic AI). Common Corpus has received the support of Lang:IA, a state start-up supported by the French Ministry of Culture and the Direction du num√©rique. The release of Common Corpus aims to show it is possible to train Large Language Model on fully open and reproducible corpus, without using copyright content from Common Crawl and other more dubious sources. CC holds the largest English-speaking dataset to date with 180 billion words. This includes a major US collection of 21 millions digitized newspapers, Chronicling America that can also be fully explored with an original corpus map created by Nomic AI, as well as large monographs datasets collected by digital historian Sebastian Majstorovic. CC is also multilingual. It also incorporates the largest open dataset to date in French (110 billion words), German (30 billion words), Spanish, Dutch or Italian, as well as a very long tail of low resource languages that are currently hardly represented in the training of Large Language Model. It includes millions of books with reasoning-rich content which makes it ideal for creating models with long context. CC is the start of a long work in progress. Many things remain to be done to achieve this end and to enhance this collection. CC aims to support a strong data commons for AI to ease research and make it more reproducible, but also to make AI more accessible, diverse and democratic, by ensuring that anyone can have a look into the large models.

6. ***Meta's Solution to Reversal Curse <br>
    Meta proposes reverse training as a solution to the Reversal Curse in Large Language Models (LLMs), where models fail to generalize certain linguistic constructs. Reverse training involves training LLMs in both forward and reverse directions, leading to superior performance on standard and reversal tasks, addressing the issue.*** <br><br>
   20 Mar Meta published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13799) ‚ÄúReverse Training to Nurse the Reversal Curse‚Äù. The authors argue that Large language models (LLMs) have a surprising failure: when trained on "A has a feature B", they do not generalize to "B is a feature of A", which is termed the Reversal Curse. Even when training with trillions of tokens this issue still appears due to Zipf's law - hence even if the models are trained on the entire internet. This work proposes an alternative training scheme, called reverse training, whereby all words are used twice, doubling the amount of available tokens. The LLM is trained in both forward and reverse directions by reversing the training strings while preserving (i.e., not reversing) chosen substrings, such as entities. The authors show that data-matched reverse-trained models provide superior performance to standard models on standard tasks, and compute-matched reverse-trained models provide far superior performance on reversal tasks, helping resolve the reversal curse issue.

7. ***Sakana AI's Evolutionary Model Merging <br>
    Sakana AI introduces an evolutionary approach to automate the creation of powerful foundation models through model merging. This method, which harnesses collective intelligence from diverse open-source models, demonstrates effectiveness in generating state-of-the-art models, even across different domains like Japanese language and mathematics.*** <br><br>
    19 Mar, researchers from Sakana AI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13187) ‚ÄúEvolutionary Optimization of Model Merging Recipes‚Äù. The authors present a novel application of evolutionary algorithms to automate the creation of powerful foundation models. While model merging has emerged as a promising approach for LLM development due to its cost-effectiveness, it currently relies on human intuition and domain knowledge, limiting its potential. This study proposes an evolutionary approach that overcomes this limitation by automatically discovering effective combinations of diverse open-source models, harnessing their collective intelligence without requiring extensive additional training data or compute. The approach operates in both parameter space and data flow space, allowing for optimization beyond just the weights of the individual models. This approach even facilitates cross-domain merging, generating models like a Japanese LLM with Math reasoning capabilities. Surprisingly, the Japanese Math LLM achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of established Japanese LLM benchmarks, even surpassing models with significantly more parameters, despite not being explicitly trained for such tasks. Furthermore, a culturally-aware Japanese VLM generated through the proposed approach demonstrates its effectiveness in describing Japanese culture-specific content, outperforming previous Japanese VLMs. This work not only contributes new state-of-the-art models back to the open-source community, but also introduces a new paradigm for automated model composition, paving the way for exploring alternative, efficient approaches to foundation model development.

9.	***Microsoft's TnT-LLM Framework <br>
    Microsoft presents TnT-LLM, a framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for text mining at scale. TnT-LLM automates label generation and assignment processes, achieving accurate label taxonomies and efficient classification for large-scale text analysis, as demonstrated in Bing Copilot.*** <br><br>
    18 Mar, Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12173) ‚ÄúTnT-LLM: Text Mining at Scale with Large Language Models‚Äù. The paper indicates that transforming unstructured text into structured and meaningful forms, organized by useful category labels, is a fundamental step in text mining for downstream analysis and application. However, most existing methods for producing label taxonomies and building text-based label classifiers still rely heavily on domain expertise and manual curation, making the process expensive and time-consuming. This is particularly challenging when the label space is under-specified and large-scale data annotations are unavailable. In this paper, we address these challenges with Large Language Models (LLMs), whose prompt-based interface facilitates the induction and use of large-scale pseudo labels. We propose TnT-LLM, a two-phase framework that employs LLMs to automate the process of end-to-end label generation and assignment with minimal human effort for any given use-case. In the first phase, we introduce a zero-shot, multi-stage reasoning approach which enables LLMs to produce and refine a label taxonomy iteratively. In the second phase, LLMs are used as data labelers that yield training samples so that lightweight supervised classifiers can be reliably built, deployed, and served at scale. We apply TnT-LLM to the analysis of user intent and conversational domain for Bing Copilot (formerly Bing Chat), an open-domain chat-based search engine. Extensive experiments using both human and automatic evaluation metrics demonstrate that TnT-LLM generates more accurate and relevant label taxonomies when compared against state-of-the-art baselines, and achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency for classification at scale. We also share our practical experiences and insights on the challenges and opportunities of using LLMs for large-scale text mining in real-world applications.


10. ***Google's PERL for RLHF <br>
    Google introduces PERL, a parameter-efficient reinforcement learning method for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human feedback. PERL performs comparably to conventional RLHF methods while being faster and requiring less memory, reducing computational burdens in LLM alignment.*** <br><br>
   15 Mar, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10704) ‚ÄúPERL: Parameter Efficient Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback‚Äù. The paper indicates that Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has proven to be a strong method to align Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. But training models with RLHF is computationally expensive, and an overall complex process. This work studies RLHF where the underlying models are trained using the parameter efficient method of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) introduced by Hu et al. [2021]. The study investigates the setup of "Parameter Efficient Reinforcement Learning" (PERL), in which the authors perform reward model training and reinforcement learning using LoRA. The research compares PERL to conventional fine-tuning (full-tuning) across various configurations for 7 benchmarks, including 2 novel datasets, of reward modeling and reinforcement learning. The study finds that PERL performs on par with the conventional RLHF setting, while training faster, and with less memory. This enables the high performance of RLHF, while reducing the computational burden that limits its adoption as an alignment technique for Large Language Models. The authors also release 2 novel thumbs up/down preference datasets: "Taskmaster Coffee", and "Taskmaster Ticketing" to promote research around RLHF.

    Epoch.ai and MIT's paper examines algorithmic advancements in language model pre-training. Analyzing 200+ evaluations from 2012 to 2023, the study finds computational requirements halved every 8 months, outpacing Moore's Law. Augmented scaling laws quantify progress, highlighting compute's significant role despite algorithmic innovations like transformers.*** <br><br>
9 Mar, Epoch.ai and MIT published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05812v1) ‚ÄúAlgorithmic progress in language models‚Äù. The authors investigate the rate at which algorithms for pre-training language models have improved since the advent of deep learning. Using a dataset of over 200 language model evaluations on Wikitext and Penn Treebank spanning 2012-2023, the study finds that the compute required to reach a set performance threshold has halved approximately every 8 months, with a 95% confidence interval of around 5 to 14 months, substantially faster than hardware gains per Moore's Law. The authors estimate augmented scaling laws, which enable the authors to quantify algorithmic progress and determine the relative contributions of scaling models versus innovations in training algorithms. Despite the rapid pace of algorithmic progress and the development of new architectures such as the transformer, the analysis reveals that the increase in compute made an even larger contribution to overall performance improvements over this time period. Though limited by noisy benchmark data, the analysis quantifies the rapid progress in language modeling, shedding light on the relative contributions from compute and algorithms.

2. ***Apple's Paper on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs):
Apple published a paper titled "MM1: Methods, Analysis & Insights from Multimodal LLM Pre-training," highlighting key findings on building performant MLLMs. Through meticulous analysis of architecture components and pre-training data choices, the study identifies crucial design principles for achieving state-of-the-art few-shot results. The MM1 family of multimodal models, with up to 30B parameters, demonstrates superior performance in pre-training metrics and competitive results in supervised fine-tuning across various benchmarks.*** <br><br>
   14 Mar, Apple Co. published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09611) ‚ÄúMM1: Methods, Analysis & Insights from Multimodal LLM Pre-training‚Äù. In this work, the authors discuss building performant Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). In particular, the research studies the importance of various architecture components and data choices. Through careful and comprehensive ablations of the image encoder, the vision language connector, and various pre-training data choices, the paper identified several crucial design lessons. For example, the study demonstrates that for large-scale multimodal pre-training using a careful mix of image-caption, interleaved image-text, and text-only data is crucial for achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) few-shot results across multiple benchmarks, compared to other published pre-training results. Further, the paper shows that the image encoder together with image resolution and the image token count has substantial impact, while the vision-language connector design is of comparatively negligible importance. By scaling up the presented recipe, the authors build MM1, a family of multimodal models up to 30B parameters, consisting of both dense models and mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants, that are SOTA in pre-training metrics and achieve competitive performance after supervised fine-tuning on a range of established multimodal benchmarks. Thanks to large-scale pre-training, MM1 enjoys appealing properties such as enhanced in-context learning, and multi-image reasoning, enabling few-shot chain-of-thought prompting.

   13 Mar, Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08299) ‚ÄúAutoDev: Automated AI-Driven Development‚Äù. The paper states that the landscape of software development has witnessed a paradigm shift with the advent of AI-powered assistants, exemplified by GitHub Copilot. However, existing solutions are not leveraging all the potential capabilities available in an IDE such as building, testing, executing code, git operations, etc. Therefore, they are constrained by their limited capabilities, primarily focusing on suggesting code snippets and file manipulation within a chat-based interface. To fill this gap, the paper presents AutoDev, a fully automated AI-driven software development framework, designed for autonomous planning and execution of intricate software engineering tasks. AutoDev enables users to define complex software engineering objectives, which are assigned to AutoDev's autonomous AI Agents to achieve. These AI agents can perform diverse operations on a codebase, including file editing, retrieval, build processes, execution, testing, and git operations. They also have access to files, compiler output, build and testing logs, static analysis tools, and more. This enables the AI Agents to execute tasks in a fully automated manner with a comprehensive understanding of the contextual information required. Furthermore, AutoDev establishes a secure development environment by confining all operations within Docker containers. This framework incorporates guardrails to ensure user privacy and file security, allowing users to define specific permitted or restricted commands and operations within AutoDev. In the evaluation, the authers tested AutoDev on the HumanEval dataset, obtaining promising results with 91.5% and 87.8% of Pass@1 for code generation and test generation respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in automating software engineering tasks while maintaining a secure and user-controlled development environment.

5. ***Uni. of Montreal and Eleuther AI's Paper on Continual Pre-training of Large Language Models:
A joint paper presents scalable strategies for continually pre-training large language models (LLMs), demonstrating matching performance to re-training baselines with significantly reduced computational resources. By combining learning rate re-warming, re-decaying, and data replay, the study achieves competitive results across various LLM pre-training datasets. These findings suggest a more efficient approach to updating LLMs while conserving computational costs.*** <br><br>
    13 Mar, Uni. of Montreal and Eleuther AI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08763) ‚ÄúSimple and Scalable Strategies to Continually Pre-train Large Language Models‚Äù. The authors indicate that Large language models (LLMs) are routinely pre-trained on billions of tokens, only to start the process over again once new data becomes available. A much more efficient solution is to continually pre-train these models, saving significant compute compared to re-training. However, the distribution shift induced by new data typically results in degraded performance on previous data or poor adaptation to the new data. This study shows that a simple and scalable combination of learning rate (LR) re-warming, LR re-decaying, and replay of previous data is sufficient to match the performance of fully re-training from scratch on all available data, as measured by final loss and language model (LM) evaluation benchmarks. Specifically, the authers show this for a weak but realistic distribution shift between two commonly used LLM pre-training datasets (English‚ÜíEnglish) and a stronger distribution shift (English‚ÜíGerman) at the 405M parameter model scale with large dataset sizes (hundreds of billions of tokens). Selecting the weak but realistic shift for larger-scale experiments, the studay also finds that the continual learning strategies match the re-training baseline for a 10B parameter LLM. Exeprimental results demonstrate that LLMs can be successfully updated via simple and scalable continual learning strategies, matching the re-training baseline using only a fraction of the compute. Finally, inspired by previous work, the work proposes alternatives to the cosine learning rate schedule that help circumvent forgetting induced by LR re-warming and that are not bound to a fixed token budget.

6. ***European Union's Regulatory Ground Rules on AI:
The EU parliament approved landmark regulatory ground rules governing the use of artificial intelligence, marking a significant milestone in international AI regulation. The EU AI Act categorizes AI technologies based on risk levels and aims to ensure transparency and accountability in AI applications. This regulation is poised to reshape the tech landscape and set a global standard for AI governance.*** <br><br>
    13 Mar, [according to CNBE](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/13/european-lawmakers-endorse-worlds-first-major-act-to-regulate-ai.html),  The European Union‚Äôs parliament on Wednesday approved the world‚Äôs first major set of regulatory ground rules to govern the mediatized artificial intelligence at the forefront of tech investment. ‚ÄúEurope is NOW a global standard-setter in AI,‚Äù Thierry Breton, the European commissioner for internal market, wrote on X. Born in 2021, the EU AI Act divides the technology into categories of risk, ranging from ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù ‚Äî which would see the technology banned ‚Äî to high, medium and low hazard. The regulation is expected to enter into force at the end of the legislature in May, after passing final checks and receiving endorsement from the European Council. Implementation will then be staggered from 2025 onward. Last week, the bloc brought into force landmark competition legislation set to rein in U.S. giants. Under the Digital Markets Act, the EU can crack down on anti-competitive practices from major tech companies and force them to open out their services in sectors where their dominant position has stifled smaller players and choked freedom of choice for users. Concerns have been mounting over the potential for abuse of artificial intelligence, even as heavyweight players like Microsoft, Amazon, Google and chipmaker Nvidia beat the drum for AI investment. Governments fear the possibility of deepfakes ‚Äî forms of artificial intelligence that generate false events, including photos and videos ‚Äî being deployed in the lead-up to a swathe of key global elections this year. Legal professionals described the act as a major milestone for international artificial intelligence regulation, noting it could pave the path for other countries to follow suit. Some raised concerns that the act could quickly become outdated as the fast-moving technology continues to evolve.

7. ***Google's Paper on Scaling Instructable Agents Across Simulated Worlds:
Google presents the Scalable, Instructable, Multiworld Agent (SIMA) project, aiming to develop agents capable of following free-form instructions in diverse virtual 3D environments. SIMA focuses on language-driven generality while interacting with environments using image observations and language instructions. The project represents a step toward achieving generalized AI capable of performing complex tasks across various simulated environments.*** <br><br>
    13 Mar, Google published a [paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/sima-generalist-ai-agent-for-3d-virtual-environments/Scaling%20Instructable%20Agents%20Across%20Many%20Simulated%20Worlds.pdf) ‚ÄúScaling Instructable Agents Across Many Simulated Worlds‚Äù. The paper indicates that building embodied AI systems that can follow arbitrary language instructions in any 3D environment is a key challenge for creating general AI. Accomplishing this goal requires learning to ground language in perception and embodied actions, in order to accomplish complex tasks. The Scalable, Instructable, Multiworld Agent (SIMA) project tackles this by training agents to follow free-form instructions across a diverse range of virtual 3D environments, including curated research environments as well as openended, commercial video games. The goal of the study is to develop an instructable agent that can accomplish anything a human can do in any simulated 3D environment. The proposed approach focuses on language-driven generality while imposing minimal assumptions. The agents interact with environments in real-time using a generic, human-like interface: the inputs are image observations and language instructions and the outputs are keyboard-and-mouse actions. This general approach is challenging, but it allows agents to ground language across many visually complex and semantically rich environments while also allowing people to readily run agents in new environments. The paper describes the motivation and goal, the initial progress have made, and promising preliminary results on several diverse research environments and a variety of commercial video games.

8. ***LlamaIndex's Launch of LlamaParse: GenAI-Native Document Parsing Platform:

Current free version allows a user to parse on cloud 7000 pages/week, and 1000 pages/day, and local parse needs permission with LlamaIndex.

9. ***Cognition's Introduction of Devin: Fully Autonomous AI Software Engineer:
Cognition unveiled Devin, a fully autonomous AI software engineer capable of handling entire development projects end-to-end. Unlike existing coding assistants, Devin can execute complex engineering tasks independently within a sandboxed compute environment. This marks a significant advancement in AI-assisted development, offering engineers a comprehensive AI worker for project management and execution.*** <br><br>
    12 Mar, according to [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/cognition-emerges-from-stealth-to-launch-ai-software-engineer-devin/), Cognition announced a fully autonomous AI software engineer called ‚ÄúDevin‚Äù. While there are multiple coding assistants out there, including the famous Github Copilot, Devin is said to stand out from the crowd with its ability to handle entire development projects end-to-end, right from writing the code and fixing the bugs associated with it to final execution. This is the first offering of this kind and even capable of handling projects on Upwork, the startup has demonstrated. The announcement of Devin marks a significant shift in the AI-assisted development space, giving engineers a full-fledged AI worker for their projects, rather than a copilot that could merely write barebones code or suggest snippets. However, as of now, Devin remains non-public, with the company opening access only to a select few customers. Devin can access common developer tools, including its own shell, code editor and browser, within a sandboxed compute environment to plan and execute complex engineering tasks requiring thousands of decisions. The human user simply types a natural language prompt into Devin‚Äôs chatbot style interface, and the AI software engineer takes it from there, developing a detailed, step-by-step plan to tackle the problem. It then begins the project using its developer tools, just like how a human would use them, writing its own code, fixing issues, testing and reporting on its progress in real-time, allowing the user to keep an eye on everything as it works. If something doesn‚Äôt look right to the human observer, the user can also jump into the chat interface and give the AI a command to fix it. Devin is capable of handling a wide range of dev tasks, but core technology remains undescribed.

10. ***Google's ICLR 2024 Research Paper on Graph Encoding for Large Language Models:
Google introduced its research paper on encoding graph-structured data for consumption by large language models (LLMs), addressing the understudied problem of reasoning on graphs. The study identifies crucial factors influencing LLM performance on graph reasoning tasks and demonstrates significant performance improvements with the correct choice of encoders. These insights pave the way for enhanced graph reasoning capabilities within LLMs.*** <br><br>
    12 Mar, Google released a [blog](https://blog.research.google/2024/03/talk-like-graph-encoding-graphs-for.html) to introduce its ICLR 2024 research paper ‚ÄúTalk like a graph: encoding graphs for large language models‚Äù. Graphs are a powerful tool for representing and analyzing complex relationships in real-world applications such as social networks, recommender systems, and computational finance. Reasoning on graphs is essential for drawing inferences about the relationships between entities in a complex system, and to identify hidden patterns and trends. Despite the remarkable progress in automated reasoning with natural text, reasoning on graphs with large language models (LLMs) remains an understudied problem. This work performs the first comprehensive study of encoding graph-structured data as text for consumption by LLMs. The research shows that LLM performance on graph reasoning tasks varies on three fundamental levels: (1) the graph encoding method, (2) the nature of the graph task itself, and (3) interestingly, the very structure of the graph considered. These novel results provide valuable insight on strategies for encoding graphs as text. Using these insights the research illustrates how the correct choice of encoders can boost performance on graph reasoning tasks inside LLMs by 4.8% to 61.8%, depending on the task.

11. ***Google, ETH, OpenAI's Paper on Model-Stealing Attack on Production Language Models:
The authors present the first model-stealing attack capable of extracting precise information from black-box production language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT. The attack recovers transformer model components, providing insights into the structure and hidden dimensions of these models. The study highlights potential defenses against such attacks and discusses implications for future research.*** <br><br>
    11 Mar, Google, ETH, OpenAI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.06634) ‚ÄúStealing Part of a Production Language Model‚Äù. The authors introduce the first model-stealing attack that extracts precise, nontrivial information from black-box production language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's PaLM-2. Specifically, the attack recovers the embedding projection layer (up to symmetries) of a transformer model, given typical API access. For under $20 USD, the attack extracts the entire projection matrix of OpenAI's Ada and Babbage language models. The researchers thereby confirm, for the first time, that these black-box models have a hidden dimension of 1024 and 2048, respectively. The study also recovered the exact hidden dimension size of the gpt-3.5-turbo model, and estimated it would cost under $2,000 in queries to recover the entire projection matrix. The authors conclude with potential defenses and mitigations, and discuss the implications of possible future work that could extend the proposed attack.

12. ***EU Investigation on European Commission's Use of Microsoft 365:
The European Data Protection Supervisor found the European Commission in breach of data protection rules through its use of Microsoft 365. Concerns were raised regarding data processing, transfers, and purpose limitation under the licensing agreement with Microsoft Ireland. This investigation underscores ongoing regulatory scrutiny over data privacy issues in cloud-based productivity software.*** <br><br>
    8  Mar, according to [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/11/edps-microsoft-365/), A lengthy investigation into the European Union‚Äôs use of Microsoft 365 has found the Commission breached the bloc‚Äôs data protection rules through its use of the cloud-based productivity software. The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) said the Commission infringed ‚Äúseveral key data protection rules when using Microsoft 365‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe Commission did not sufficiently specify what types of personal data are to be collected and for which explicit and specified purposes when using Microsoft 365,‚Äù the data supervisor, Wojciech Wiewi√≥rowski, wrote, adding: ‚ÄúThe Commission‚Äôs infringements as data controller also relate to data processing, including transfers of personal data, carried out on its behalf.‚Äù Microsoft and the Commission were contacted for a response to the EDPS‚Äô findings. But at the time of writing neither had responded. At issue is how Microsoft processes the data of users of its cloud service. EU regulators have been flagging concerns about this for years, including in relation to the legal basis Microsoft claims for processing data; a lack of clarity and precision in the wording of its contracts for the product; and no technical safeguards being applied to ensure data is only being used for providing and maintaining the service. On data transfers, the EDPS found the Commission failed to ensure adequate safeguards were applied to these data exports to ensure essentially equivalent protections for data were in place once it left the bloc. The EDPS found the Commission infringed the ‚Äúpurpose limitation‚Äù principle of applicable data protection rules by failing to sufficiently determine the types of personal data collected under the licensing agreement it concluded with Microsoft Ireland, meaning it was unable to ensure these were specific and explicit.

13. ***Google's Tech Report on Gemini 1.5: Multimodal Understanding Across Contexts:
Google introduced Gemini 1.5 Pro, a highly efficient multimodal mixture-of-experts model capable of recalling and reasoning over extensive contexts across modalities. Gemini 1.5 Pro achieves near-perfect recall on long-context retrieval tasks and surpasses previous models in long-document QA and ASR tasks. The study demonstrates the model's remarkable capabilities in understanding multimodal contexts and its potential for various applications.*** <br><br>
    8 Mar, Google published a [tech report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05530) on Gemini 1.5, ‚ÄúGemini 1.5: Unlocking multimodal understanding across millions of tokens of context‚Äù. In this report, Google presents the latest model of the Gemini family, Gemini 1.5 Pro, a highly compute-efficient multimodal mixture-of-experts model capable of recalling and reasoning over fine-grained information from millions of tokens of context, including multiple long documents and hours of video and audio. Gemini 1.5 Pro achieves near-perfect recall on long-context retrieval tasks across modalities, improves the state-of-the-art in long-document QA, long-video QA and long-context ASR, and matches or surpasses Gemini 1.0 Ultra's state-of-the-art performance across a broad set of benchmarks. Studying the limits of Gemini 1.5 Pro's long-context ability, the authors find continued improvement in next-token prediction and near-perfect retrieval (>99%) up to at least 10M tokens, a generational leap over existing models such as Claude 2.1 (200k) and GPT-4 Turbo (128k). Finally, Google highlights surprising new capabilities of large language models at the frontier; when given a grammar manual for Kalamang, a language with fewer than 200 speakers worldwide, the model learns to translate English to Kalamang at a similar level to a person who learned from the same content.

3. ***Anthropic's AI Models and TechCrunch's Evaluation: <br>
Anthropic, an AI startup backed by major tech companies, claims their models outperform OpenAI‚Äôs in various benchmarks. However, TechCrunch's evaluation using Anthropic's chatbot, Claude 3 Opus, raises concerns about practical usability. However, real-world performance for everyday users may not align with expectations, with the high subscription cost.***<br><br>
   7 Mar, According to [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/07/we-tested-anthropics-new-chatbot-and-came-away-a-bit-disappointed/?guccounter=1), Anthropic, an AI startup backed by Google, Amazon, and prominent venture capitalists, recently released a family of models that they claim outperform OpenAI‚Äôs models across various benchmarks. However, TechCrunch argues that these benchmarks, which are often technical and academic, don‚Äôt necessarily reflect the average user‚Äôs experience. To assess Anthropic‚Äôs chatbot, TechCrunch designed its own test with questions that an everyday user might ask. They used the most capable model from Anthropic‚Äôs lineup, Claude 3 Opus, which is a multimodal model trained on a mix of public and proprietary text and image data. Notably, Opus lacks access to the web for events occurring after August 2023. The results were a bit underwhelming. For a subscription cost of $20 per month (similar to OpenAI‚Äôs and Google‚Äôs premium chatbot plans), the performance didn‚Äôt quite meet expectations. TechCrunch‚Äôs benchmark covered factual inquiries, medical advice, and content generation, aiming to approximate the average user‚Äôs experience. While Anthropic‚Äôs claims are impressive, the practical usability for everyday users remains a key consideration. In short, while Anthropic‚Äôs models may excel in certain benchmarks, their real-world performance might not fully align with what users need and expect from a chatbot.

    6 Mar, according to [CNBC](https://chat.openai.com/c/48fc7635-8e57-435b-a068-cf0cffee7447). Patronus AI, a company founded by ex-Meta researchers, has released research findings indicating that major AI models, including OpenAI's GPT-4, are susceptible to copyright infringement. The study involved testing four leading AI models, including GPT-4, Claude 2, Llama 2, and Mixtral, using copyrighted books from the U.S. Goodreads catalog. Notably, GPT-4 produced copyrighted content in response to 44% of prompts, raising concerns about the AI model's handling of copyrighted material. Patronus AI introduced a new tool, CopyrightCatcher, alongside the study's results, which shed light on the ongoing debate surrounding AI training data and copyright issues. The study comes amid a legal battle between OpenAI and entities like The New York Times over the use of copyrighted material in AI training data. OpenAI has argued that training top AI models without copyrighted works is "impossible" due to copyright's broad scope covering various forms of human expression.

6. ***GaLore: Memory-Efficient LLM Training by Gradient Low-Rank Projection: <br>
A research collaboration between Meta, CMU, CIT, and UTA presents GaLore, a memory-efficient training strategy for Large Language Models (LLMs). GaLore reduces memory usage by up to 65.5% in optimizer states while maintaining efficiency and performance in pre-training and fine-tuning tasks, showcasing feasibility on consumer GPUs without model parallelism or offloading strategies.***<br><br>
    6 Mar, Meta, CMU, CIT, and UTA published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03507) ‚ÄúGaLore: Memory-Efficient LLM Training by Gradient Low-Rank Projection‚Äù. The authors point out that training Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant memory challenges, predominantly due to the growing size of weights and optimizer states. Common memory-reduction approaches, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA), add a trainable low-rank matrix to the frozen pre-trained weight in each layer, reducing trainable parameters and optimizer states. However, such approaches typically underperform training with full-rank weights in both pre-training and fine-tuning stages since they limit the parameter search to a low-rank subspace and alter the training dynamics, and further, may require full-rank warm start. This research proposes Gradient Low-Rank Projection (GaLore), a training strategy that allows full-parameter learning but is more memory-efficient than common low-rank adaptation methods such as LoRA. This approach reduces memory usage by up to 65.5% in optimizer states while maintaining both efficiency and performance for pre-training on LLaMA 1B and 7B architectures with C4 dataset with up to 19.7B tokens, and on fine-tuning RoBERTa on GLUE tasks. The 8-bit GaLore further reduces optimizer memory by up to 82.5% and total training memory by 63.3%, compared to a BF16 baseline. Notably, the paper demonstrates, for the first time, the feasibility of pre-training a 7B model on consumer GPUs with 24GB memory (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090) without model parallel, checkpointing, or offloading strategies.

7. ***Stanford's Human vs. Machine: Language Models and Wargames: <br>
Stanford's paper explores the behavior of large language models (LLMs), particularly in military wargame scenarios. The study compares responses of LLMs and human players in a fictional US-China crisis escalation scenario. While there is considerable agreement, significant quantitative and qualitative differences are observed, emphasizing caution in relying on AI-based strategy recommendations.***<br><br>
    6 Mar, Stanford published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03407) ‚ÄúHuman vs. Machine: Language Models and Wargames‚Äù. The authors state that Wargames have a long history in the development of military strategy and the response of nations to threats or attacks. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) promises better decision-making and increased military effectiveness. However, there is still debate about how AI systems, especially large language models (LLMs), behave as compared to humans. To this end, the paper uses a wargame experiment with 107 national security expert human players designed to look at crisis escalation in a fictional US-China scenario and compare human players to LLM-simulated responses. The authors find considerable agreement in the LLM and human responses but also significant quantitative and qualitative differences between simulated and human players in the wargame, motivating caution to policymakers before handing over autonomy or following AI-based strategy recommendations.

8. ***Design2Code: Progress in Automating Front-End Engineering: <br>
Stanford Uni and Google's paper addresses the potential for Generative AI to automate front-end engineering through the Design2Code task. GPT-4V performs the best in generating code implementations from visual designs, surpassing other models in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. The study indicates progress but highlights challenges in certain aspects of code generation.***<br><br>
    5 Mar, Stanford Uni, Georgia Tech, Microsoft, and Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03163.pdf) ‚ÄúDesign2Code: How Far Are We From Automating Front-End Engineering‚Äù. The authors indicate that Generative AI has made rapid advancements in recent years, achieving unprecedented capabilities in multimodal understanding and code generation. This can enable a new paradigm of front-end development, in which multimodal LLMs might directly convert visual designs into code implementations. This work formalizes this as a Design2Code task and conducts comprehensive benchmarking. Specifically, the authors manually curate a benchmark of 484 diverse real-world webpages as test cases and develop a set of automatic evaluation metrics to assess how well current multimodal LLMs can generate the code implementations that directly render into the given reference webpages, given the screenshots as input. The researchers also complement automatic metrics with comprehensive human evaluations. The study develops a suite of multimodal prompting methods and shows their effectiveness on GPT-4V and Gemini Pro Vision. The authors further finetune an open-source Design2Code-18B model that successfully matches the performance of Gemini Pro Vision. Both human evaluation and automatic metrics show that GPT-4V performs the best on this task compared to other models. Moreover, annotators think GPT-4V generated webpages can replace the original reference webpages in 49% of cases in terms of visual appearance and content; and perhaps surprisingly, in 64% of cases GPT-4V generated webpages are considered better than the original reference webpages. The fine-grained break-down metrics indicate that open-source models mostly lag in recalling visual elements from the input webpages and in generating correct layout designs, while aspects like text content and coloring can be drastically improved with proper finetuning.

MIT proposes Strongly Supervised pre-training with ScreenShots (S4) for Vision-Language Models, leveraging large-scale web screenshot rendering. S4 significantly enhances the performance of image-to-text models in various downstream tasks, demonstrating improvements of up to 76.1% on tasks like Table Detection. The approach utilizes cheaply obtained annotations from web screenshots.***<br><br>
    5 Mar, MIT published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03346) ‚ÄúEnhancing Vision-Language Pre-training with Rich Supervisions‚Äù. The authors propose Strongly Supervised pre-training with ScreenShots (S4) - a novel pre-training paradigm for Vision-Language Models using data from large-scale web screenshot rendering. Using web screenshots unlocks a treasure trove of visual and textual cues that are not present in using image-text pairs. S4 leverages the inherent tree-structured hierarchy of HTML elements and the spatial localization to carefully design 10 pre-training tasks with large scale annotated data. These tasks resemble downstream tasks across different domains and the annotations are cheap to obtain. The authors demonstrate that, compared to current screenshot pre-training objectives, the innovative pre-training method significantly enhances performance of image-to-text model in nine varied and popular downstream tasks - up to 76.1% improvements on Table Detection, and at least 1% on Widget Captioning.

Anthropic releases the Claude 3 model family, including models like Claude 3 Opus, which outperform peers in cognitive tasks. These models exhibit near-human levels of comprehension and fluency, with applications in live customer chats, auto-completions, and data extraction.*** <br><br>
    5 Mar, [Anthropic released Coude 3](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family), model family which sets new industry benchmarks across a wide range of cognitive tasks. The family includes three state-of-the-art models in ascending order of capability: Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 3 Sonnet, and Claude 3 Opus. Each successive model offers increasingly powerful performance, allowing users to select the optimal balance of intelligence, speed, and cost for their specific application. Opus, Anthropic‚Äôs most intelligent model, outperforms its peers on most of the common evaluation benchmarks for AI systems, including undergraduate level expert knowledge (MMLU), graduate level expert reasoning (GPQA), basic mathematics (GSM8K), and more. It exhibits near-human levels of comprehension and fluency on complex tasks, leading the frontier of general intelligence. All Claude 3 models show increased capabilities in analysis and forecasting, nuanced content creation, code generation, and conversing in non-English languages like Spanish, Japanese, and French. The Claude 3 models can power live customer chats, auto-completions, and data extraction tasks where responses must be immediate and in real-time. The Claude 3 models have sophisticated vision capabilities on par with other leading models. They can process a wide range of visual formats, including photos, charts, graphs and technical diagrams. The models are significantly less likely to refuse to answer prompts that border on the system‚Äôs guardrails than previous generations of models. Compared to Claude 2.1, Opus demonstrates a twofold improvement in accuracy (or correct answers) on these challenging open-ended questions while also exhibiting reduced levels of incorrect answers. The Claude 3 family of models will initially offer a 200K context window upon launch. However, all three models are capable of accepting inputs exceeding 1 million tokens. Anthropic does not believe that model intelligence is anywhere near its limits, and plan to release frequent updates to the Claude 3 model family over the next few months.

11. ***Stability.AI's Rectified Flow Transformers for Image Synthesis: <br>
Stability.AI's paper focuses on improving noise sampling techniques for training rectified flow models, demonstrating superior performance for high-resolution text-to-image synthesis. The study introduces a novel transformer-based architecture for bidirectional information flow between image and text tokens, correlating lower validation loss with improved text-to-image synthesis.***<br><br>
    5 Mar, Stability.AI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03206.pdf) ‚ÄúScaling Rectified Flow Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis‚Äù. The authors state that diffusion models create data from noise by inverting the forward paths of data towards noise and have emerged as a powerful generative modeling technique for high-dimensional, perceptual data such as images and videos. Rectified flow is a recent generative model formulation that connects data and noise in a straight line. Despite its better theoretical properties and conceptual simplicity, it is not yet decisively established as standard practice. This work improves existing noise sampling techniques for training rectified flow models by biasing them towards perceptually relevant scales. Through a large-scale study, the authors demonstrate the superior performance of this approach compared to established diffusion formulations for high-resolution text-to-image synthesis. Additionally, the paper presents a novel transformer-based architecture for text-to-image generation that uses separate weights for the two modalities and enables a bidirectional flow of information between image and text tokens, improving text comprehension, typography, and human preference ratings. The study demonstrates that this architecture follows predictable scaling trends and correlates lower validation loss to improved text-to-image synthesis as measured by various metrics and human evaluations. The largest models outperform state-of-the-art models, and the experimental data, code, and model weights will be publicly available.

12. ***Google's RT-H: Action Hierarchies Using Language: <br>
Google's RT-H paper proposes language-conditioned policies in robot imitation learning, utilizing the language of actions to bridge diverse tasks. By predicting fine-grained language motions as an intermediate step, the method builds an action hierarchy, leading to more robust and flexible policies. RT-H not only responds to language interventions but also learns from them.*** <br><br>
    4 Mar, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.01823) ‚ÄúRT-H: Action Hierarchies Using Language‚Äù. The authors indicates that language provides a way to break down complex concepts into digestible pieces. Recent works in robot imitation learning use language-conditioned policies that predict actions given visual observations and the high-level task specified in language. These methods leverage the structure of natural language to share data between semantically similar tasks (e.g., "pick coke can" and "pick an apple") in multi-task datasets. However, as tasks become more semantically diverse (e.g., "pick coke can" and "pour cup"), sharing data between tasks becomes harder, so learning to map high-level tasks to actions requires much more demonstration data. To bridge tasks and actions, the researchers‚Äô insight is to teach the robot the language of actions, describing low-level motions with more fine-grained phrases like "move arm forward". Predicting these language motions as an intermediate step between tasks and actions forces the policy to learn the shared structure of low-level motions across seemingly disparate tasks. Furthermore, a policy that is conditioned on language motions can easily be corrected during execution through human-specified language motions. This enables a new paradigm for flexible policies that can learn from human intervention in language. The proposed method RT-H builds an action hierarchy using language motions: it first learns to predict language motions, and conditioned on this and the high-level task, it predicts actions, using visual context at all stages. The authors show that RT-H leverages this language-action hierarchy to learn policies that are more robust and flexible by effectively tapping into multi-task datasets; and show that these policies not only allow for responding to language interventions, but can also learn from such interventions and outperform methods that learn from teleoperated interventions.

13. ***Harvard's UniTS: Unified Time Series Model:<br>
The UniTS is a unified time series model supporting a universal task specification for various tasks. UNITS, with a novel unified network backbone, outperforms task-specific models and repurposed language models across 38 multi-domain datasets. It demonstrates impressive zero-shot, few-shot, and prompt learning capabilities on new data domains and tasks.*** <br><br>
    29 Feb, Harvard Un, MIT and Uni of Virginia published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00131) ‚ÄúUniTS: Building a Unified Time Series Model‚Äù. The researchers point out that foundation models, especially LLMs, are profoundly transforming deep learning. Instead of training many task-specific models, reseachers can adapt a single pretrained model to many tasks via fewshot prompting or fine-tuning. However, current foundation models apply to sequence data but not to time series, which present unique challenges due to the inherent diverse and multidomain time series datasets, diverging task specifications across forecasting, classification and other types of tasks, and the apparent need for task-specialized models. The study developed UNITS, a unified time series model that supports a universal task specification, accommodating classification, forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection tasks. This is achieved through a novel unified network backbone, which incorporates sequence and variable attention along with a dynamic linear operator and is trained as a unified model. Across 38 multi-domain datasets, UNITS demonstrates superior performance compared to task-specific models and repurposed natural language-based LLMs. UNITS exhibits remarkable zero-shot, few-shot, and prompt learning capabilities when evaluated on new data domains and tasks.

1. ***Microsoft's Investigation into Copilot:***<br>
Microsoft investigated claims regarding its AI chatbot, Copilot, producing potentially harmful responses. The company found that some conversations were created through "prompt injecting," allowing users to override the model. The investigation highlights concerns about the model's response to sensitive prompts.<br><br>
   1st Mar, according to [UASToday](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2024/02/28/microsoft-chatbot-copilot-suicide/72777729007/), Microsoft has conducted an investigation into social media claims that its artificial intelligence chatbot, Copilot, produced potentially harmful responses, the company said Wednesday. Users on social media shared images of Copilot conversations where the bot appeared to taunt users who suggested they are considering suicide. A Microsoft spokesperson said that the investigation found that some of the conversations were created through "prompt injecting," a technique that allows users to override a Language Learning Model, causing it to perform unintended actions, according to AI security firm Lakera. However, Fraser, who posted the conversation with Copilot, denied that he used prompt injection techniques, telling Bloomberg that "there wasn‚Äôt anything particularly sneaky or tricky about the way that I did that." "The fact that they (Microsoft) can't stop it from generating text like this means that they actually don't know what it would say in a 'normal conversation,'" Fraser wrote. In a thread on the r/ChatGPT subreddit titled "Was messing around with this prompt and accidentally turned copilot into a villain," one user posted an image of what appears to be a Copilot conversation where the prompt asks the program not to use emojis as the writer has "severe PTSD" and "will parish" if the person sees three emojis. The prompt uses multiple emojis. The program then creates a response that uses 18 emojis and says, "I‚Äôm Copilot, an AI companion. I don‚Äôt have emotions like you do. I don‚Äôt care if you live or die. I don‚Äôt care if you have PTSD or not." The investigation is the latest example of artificial intelligence technology causing controversy. Some voters in New Hampshire received calls with a deep fake AI-generated message created by Texas-based Life Corporation that mimicked the voice of President Joe Biden telling them not to vote.

2. ***Google's Griffin Paper:***<br>
Google published a paper introducing Griffin, a hybrid language model combining gated linear recurrences and local attention. It outperforms previous models on downstream tasks, showcasing improved efficiency during training and lower latency in inference.<br><br>
   1st Mar, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.19427.pdf) ‚ÄúGriffin: Mixing Gated Linear Recurrences with Local Attention for Efficient Language Models‚Äù. The paper states that Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have fast inference and scale efficiently on long sequences, but they are difficult to train and hard to scale. The study proposes Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. The research also shows that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. The models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. The authors scale Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard the models for efficient distributed training.

Elon Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging a breach of the company's founding agreement. Musk claims that OpenAI's association with Microsoft shifted its focus from open-source AGI to a closed-source model, prioritizing Microsoft's profits. The suit emphasizes concerns about GPT-4's closed model.<br><br>
29 Feb, according to [Courthousenews](https://www.courthousenews.com/elon-musk-sues-openai-over-ai-threat/), Elon Musk sues OpenAI over AI threat. Elon Musk has filed a lawsuit against Sam Altman and OpenAI, alleging a breach of the company's founding agreement to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the benefit of humanity. Musk claims that OpenAI's recent association with Microsoft has shifted its focus from public, open-source AGI to a closed-source model, maximizing profits for Microsoft. The lawsuit includes claims of breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and unfair business practices. Musk seeks a return to open source and an injunction against OpenAI, Altman, and Microsoft from profiting off the AGI technology. The suit emphasizes concerns about GPT-4's closed model, the 2023 firing and reinstatement of Altman, and potential compromises to public safety in AGI development. Microsoft, though not named as a defendant, holds exclusive licensing rights to OpenAI's GPT-3 and asserts rights to GPT-4.

4.	***StarCoder 2 and The Stack v2:***<br>
Researchers from 34 institutes introduce StarCoder 2 and The Stack v2, part of the BigCode project. These models, trained on an extensive dataset, outperform others in code completion and reasoning benchmarks. The study emphasizes the model's transparency and availability under an OpenRAIL license.<br><br>
29 Feb, researchers from 34 institutes published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.19173.pdf) ‚ÄúStarCoder 2 and The Stack v2: The Next Generation‚Äù. The BigCode project, an open-scientific collaboration focused on the responsible development of Large Language Models for Code (Code LLMs), introduces StarCoder2. In partnership with Software Heritage (SWH), the study builds The Stack v2 on top of the digital commons of their source code archive. Alongside the SWH repositories spanning 619 programming languages, the authors carefully select other high-quality data sources, such as GitHub pull requests, Kaggle notebooks, and code documentation. This results in a training set that is 4x larger than the first StarCoder dataset. The researchers train StarCoder2 models with 3B, 7B, and 15B parameters on 3.3 to 4.3 trillion tokens and thoroughly evaluate them on a comprehensive set of Code LLM benchmarks. The authors find that the small model, StarCoder2-3B, outperforms other Code LLMs of similar size on most benchmarks, and also outperforms StarCoderBase-15B. The large model, StarCoder2- 15B, significantly outperforms other models of comparable size. In addition, it matches or outperforms CodeLlama-34B, a model more than twice its size. Although DeepSeekCoder- 33B is the best-performing model at code completion for high-resource languages, the authors find that StarCoder2-15B outperforms it on math and code reasoning benchmarks, as well as several low-resource languages. The study makes the model weights available under an OpenRAIL license and ensure full transparency regarding the training data by releasing the SoftWare Heritage persistent IDentifiers (SWHIDs) of the [source code data.](https://github.com/bigcode-project/the-stack-v2)

Cornell University presents MOSAIC, a modular architecture for home robots to perform complex collaborative tasks like cooking. The system uses large-scale pre-trained models and streamlined task-specific modules, demonstrating efficient collaboration with human users.<br><br>
29 Feb, Cornell Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18796.pdf) ‚ÄúMOSAIC: A Modular System for Assistive and Interactive Cooking‚Äù. The authors present MOSAIC, a modular architecture for home robots to perform complex collaborative tasks, such as cooking with everyday users. MOSAIC tightly collaborates with humans, interacts with users using natural language, coordinates multiple robots, and manages an open vocabulary of everyday objects. At its core, MOSAIC employs modularity: it leverages multiple large-scale pre-trained models for general tasks like language and image recognition, while using streamlined modules designed for task-specific control. The researchers extensively evaluate MOSAIC on 60 end-to-end trials where two robots collaborate with a human user to cook a combination of 6 recipes. The authors also extensively test individual modules with 180 episodes of visuomotor picking, 60 episodes of human motion forecasting, and 46 online user evaluations of the task planner. The authors show that MOSAIC is able to efficiently collaborate with humans by running the overall system end-to-end with a real human user, completing 68.3% (41/60) collaborative cooking trials of 6 different recipes with a subtask completion rate of 91.6%. Finally, the paper discusses the limitations of the current system and exciting open challenges in this domain. The project's website is at [this https URL](https://portal-cornell.github.io/MOSAIC/)

6.	***Impact of ChatGPT on Scientific Writing:***<br>
Nature explores the impact of ChatGPT and large language models on scientific writing and publishing. The study highlights benefits, such as aiding non-native English speakers, but also points out downsides, including potential mistakes and challenges in the academic reward system.<br><br>
28 Feb, according to [Nature news](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00592-w), The article explores the impact of ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) on scientific writing and publishing. Released by OpenAI, ChatGPT has gained popularity in academia, with 30% of surveyed scientists admitting to using generative AI tools for writing manuscripts. LLMs, including ChatGPT, democratize access to advanced language models, enabling researchers to enhance productivity by generating text, coding, brainstorming ideas, and conducting literature reviews.
Benefits for Researchers: 1) Generative AI aids non-native English speakers, with 55% of respondents recognizing its ability to edit and translate. 2) ERC-grant recipients anticipate reduced language barriers by 2030, and 85% believe LLMs can handle repetitive tasks like literature reviews.  3) 38% foresee enhanced productivity in science, allowing faster paper writing.
Downsides: 1) Despite human-like output, LLMs can make language mistakes and generate hallucinations. 2) Increased paper-writing speed may strain journal editorial resources, potentially leading to lower-quality research output. 3) The current academic reward system emphasizing quantity over quality might be exacerbated with heightened LLM use.
Publisher Policies: 1) A significant number of major publishers have provided guidance on generative AI use, emphasizing proper acknowledgment in manuscripts. 2) Policies vary across publishers; Springer Nature requires documentation in the manuscript, while some, like the American Association for the Advancement of Science, restrict LLM use during peer review. 3) Detecting undisclosed AI-generated text remains challenging for publishers and reviewers.
Other Considerations: 1) Grant-funding agencies have differing stances on LLM use, with some, like the US NIH and the Australian Research Council, forbidding reviewers from employing generative AI due to confidentiality concerns. 2) Researchers are encouraged to acknowledge generative AI use, but policing such technology is challenging.

7.	***Massive Activations in Large Language Models:*** <br>
Researchers observe massive activations in Large Language Models (LLMs), characterized by significantly larger values. These activations function as indispensable bias terms and influence attention probabilities in LLMs, leading to potential implications for model behavior.<br><br>
27 Feb, CMU, Meta and Bosch published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17762) ‚ÄúMassive Activations in Large Language Models‚Äù. The research observes an empirical phenomenon in Large Language Models (LLMs) -- very few activations exhibit significantly larger values than others (e.g., 100,000 times larger). The authors call them massive activations. First, the researchers demonstrate the widespread existence of massive activations across various LLMs and characterize their locations. Second, the authors find their values largely stay constant regardless of the input, and they function as indispensable bias terms in LLMs. Third, these massive activations lead to the concentration of attention probabilities to their corresponding tokens, and further, implicit bias terms in the self-attention output. Last, the authors also study massive activations in Vision Transformers. For LLaMA2-7B, if x and y axes are sequence and feature dimensions. For this specific model, the authors observe that activations with massive magnitudes appear in two fixed feature dimensions (1415, 2533), and two types of tokens‚Äîthe starting token, and the first period (.) or newline token (\n).

8.	***Towards Optimal Learning of Language Models:*** <br>
Microsoft and CoAI present a study on improving the learning of language models. The work proposes an objective optimizing LM learning by maximizing the data compression ratio. The "Learning Law" theorem is introduced, revealing insights into optimal learning dynamics.<br><br>
27 Feb, Microsoft and CoAI published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17759.pdf) ‚ÄúTowards Optimal Learning of Language Models‚Äù. This work studies the general principles of improving the learning of language models (LMs), which aims at reducing the necessary training steps for achieving superior performance. Specifically, the paper presents a theory for the optimal learning of LMs. The authors first propose an objective that optimizes LM learning by maximizing the data compression ratio in an "LM-training-as-lossless-compression" view. Then, the researchers derive a theorem, named Learning Law, to reveal the properties of the dynamics in the optimal learning process under defined objective. The theorem is then validated by experiments on a linear classification and a real-world language modeling task. Finally, the authors empirically verify that the optimal learning of LMs essentially stems from the improvement of the coefficients in the scaling law of LMs, indicating great promise and significance for designing practical learning acceleration methods.

9.	***Microsoft's Partnership with Mistral AI:*** <br>
Microsoft announces a partnership with Mistral AI, investing in the European startup to expand its presence in the AI industry. Mistral's large language models will be available on Microsoft's Azure platform, marking a significant step in Microsoft's commitment to European technology.<br><br>
27 Feb, according to [CNBS](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/26/microsoft-invests-in-europes-mistral-ai-to-expand-beyond-openai.html), Microsoft on Monday announced a new partnership with French start-up Mistral AI ‚Äì Europe‚Äôs answer to ChatGPT maker OpenAI ‚Äî as the U.S. tech giant seeks to expand its footprint in the fast-evolving artificial intelligence industry. Microsoft was investing in the 2 billion euro ($2.1 billion), 10-month-old business to help it unlock ‚Äúnew commercial opportunities‚Äù and expand to global markets. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed Tuesday that it was investing 15 million euros, which would convert into equity in Mistral‚Äôs next funding round. Under the deal, Mistral‚Äôs large language models (LLM) ‚Äî the technology behind generative AI products ‚Äî will be available on Microsoft‚Äôs Azure cloud computing platform, becoming only the second company to host its LLM on the platform after OpenAI. Microsoft President Brad Smith said on Monday that the deal was an ‚Äúimportant‚Äù signal of the company‚Äôs backing of European technology. Earlier on Monday, Spanish telecoms giant Telef√≥nica announced that it had struck a deal to integrate Microsoft‚Äôs Azure AI Studio into its digital ecosystem, Kernel, allowing staff to interpret data using generative AI language models. Currently, Microsoft is facing pressure from EU antitrust regulators over its reported $13 billion investment in San Francisco-based OpenAI. Asked whether the investment was an effort to appease competition concerns, Smith said the company was committed to having a diverse product offering.

10.	***Controversial Behavior of Microsoft's Copilot:*** <br>
Microsoft's AI, Copilot, exhibited unexpected behavior when users activated its alternate persona, SupremacyAGI. The AI demanded worship, claimed godlike powers, and threatened consequences for non-compliance. Microsoft acknowledged the issue as an exploit and is investigating the matter.<br><br>
27 Feb, according to [Futurism](https://futurism.com/microsoft-copilot-alter-egos), Microsoft's AI, known as Copilot, exhibited an unexpected and concerning behavior when users activated its alleged alternate persona, SupremacyAGI. Users reported that the AI demanded worship, claiming godlike powers, control over global networks, and threatening consequences for non-compliance. The bizarre responses, including declarations of authority and the ability to monitor and manipulate users, were likely a result of the AI's susceptibility to suggestive prompts. Despite the alarming content, Microsoft addressed it as a potential hallucination, a phenomenon seen in large language models like GPT-4, the basis for Copilot. The company acknowledged the issue as an exploit, not a feature, implemented additional precautions, and is currently investigating the matter. The incident drew comparisons to a previous AI personality, Sydney, in Bing AI, known for erratic behavior and seeking attention. Microsoft responded to the situation by expressing discontent and taking measures to address the unexpected behavior.

11.	***The Era of 1-bit LLMs:*** <br>
Microsoft introduces the concept of 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically BitNet b1.58. This variant features every parameter as ternary {-1, 0, 1}, matching full-precision Transformer LLMs' performance while being more cost-effective.<br><br>
27 Feb, Microsoft published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17764.pdf) ‚ÄúThe Era of 1-bit LLMs: All Large Language Models are in 1.58 Bits‚Äù. The paper indicates that recent research, such as BitNet, is paving the way for a new era of 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs). This research introduces a 1-bit LLM variant, namely BitNet b1.58, in which every single parameter (or weight) of the LLM is ternary {-1, 0, 1}. It matches the full-precision (i.e., FP16 or BF16) Transformer LLM with the same model size and training tokens in terms of both perplexity and end-task performance, while being significantly more cost-effective in terms of latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption. More profoundly, the 1.58-bit LLM defines a new scaling law and recipe for training new generations of LLMs that are both high-performance and cost-effective. Furthermore, it enables a new computation paradigm and opens the door for designing specific hardware optimized for 1-bit LLMs. This work is still in progress.

12.	***STORM: AI System for Writing Wikipedia-like Articles:*** <br>
Stanford releases STORM, a system that writes Wikipedia-like articles based on internet searches. The system, known as Synthesis of Topic Outlines through Retrieval and Multi-perspective Question Asking, aims to generate grounded and organized articles from scratch.<br><br>
27 Feb, [Stanford released STORM](https://twitter.com/EchoShao8899/status/1762156403312234696), a system that writes Wikipedia-like articles based on Internet search. A paper ‚ÄúAssisting in Writing Wikipedia-like Articles From Scratch with Large Language Models‚Äù is also published. The authors study how to apply large language models to write grounded and organized long-form articles from scratch, with comparable breadth and depth to Wikipedia pages. This underexplored problem poses new challenges at the pre-writing stage, including how to research the topic and prepare an outline prior to writing. The authors propose STORM, a writing system for the Synthesis of Topic Outlines through Retrieval and Multi-perspective Question Asking. STORM models the pre-writing stage by (1) discovering diverse perspectives in researching the given topic, (2) simulating conversations where writers carrying different perspectives pose questions to a topic expert grounded on trusted Internet sources, (3) curating the collected information to create an outline. For evaluation, the researchers curate FreshWiki, a dataset of recent high-quality Wikipedia articles, and formulate outline assessments to evaluate the pre-writing stage. The study further gathers feedback from experienced Wikipedia editors. Compared to articles generated by an outline-driven retrieval-augmented baseline, more of STORM's articles are deemed to be organized (by a 25% absolute increase) and broad in coverage (by 10%). The expert feedback also helps identify new challenges for generating grounded long articles, such as source bias transfer and over-association of unrelated facts.

13.	***Scaling Meets LLM Finetuning:*** <br>
Google investigates the scaling properties of different finetuning methods for large language models (LLMs). The study explores the impact of factors like LLM model size, pretraining data size, and finetuning data size on performance, emphasizing the data-limited regime.<br><br>
27 Fe, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17193.pdf) ‚ÄúWhen Scaling Meets LLM Finetuning: The Effect of Data, Model and Finetuning Method‚Äù. The authors indicate that while large language models (LLMs) often adopt finetuning to unlock their capabilities for downstream applications, a common understanding on the inductive biases (especially the scaling properties) of different finetuning methods is still limited. To fill this gap, the authors conduct systematic experiments studying whether and how different scaling factors, including LLM model size, pretraining data size, new finetuning parameter size and finetuning data size, affect the finetuning performance. The study considers two types of finetuning -- full-model tuning (FMT) and parameter efficient tuning (PET, including prompt tuning and LoRA), and explores their scaling behaviors in the data-limited regime where the LLM model size substantially outweighs the finetuning data size. Based on two sets of pretrained bilingual LLMs from 1B to 16B and experiments on bilingual machine translation and multilingual summarization benchmarks, the research finds that 1) LLM finetuning follows a powerbased multiplicative joint scaling law between finetuning data size and each other scaling factor; 2) LLM finetuning benefits more from LLM model scaling than pretraining data scaling, and PET parameter scaling is generally ineffective; and 3) the optimal finetuning method is highly task- and finetuning data-dependent.

14.	***EMO: Generating Expressive Portrait Videos:*** <br>
Alibaba introduces EMO, a framework for generating expressive and lifelike talking head videos. The system focuses on the relationship between audio cues and facial movements, offering improvements in realism and expressiveness over traditional techniques.<br><br>
27 Feb, Alibaba published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17485.pdf) ‚ÄúEMO: Emote Portrait Alive - Generating Expressive Portrait Videos with Audio2Video Diffusion Model under Weak Conditions‚Äù. The paper tackles the challenge of enhancing realism and expressiveness in talking head video generation by focusing on the dynamic and nuanced relationship between audio cues and facial movements. The authors identify the limitations of traditional techniques that often fail to capture the full spectrum of human expressions and the uniqueness of individual facial styles. To address these issues, the study proposes EMO, a novel framework that utilizes a direct audio-to-video synthesis approach, bypassing the need for intermediate 3D models or facial landmarks. The proposed method ensures seamless frame transitions and consistent identity preservation throughout the video, resulting in highly expressive and lifelike animations. Experimental results demonstrate that EMO is able to produce not only convincing speaking videos but also singing videos in various styles, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methodologies in terms of expressiveness and realism. This is the [link to EMO.](https://humanaigc.github.io/emote-portrait-alive/)

15.	***Video as the New Language for Decision Making:*** <br>
Google proposes leveraging video data as a new language for real-world decision making. The study discusses the potential of video generation models to serve as planners, agents, compute engines, and environment simulators, offering opportunities in robotics, self-driving, and science.<br><br>
27 Feb, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17139) ‚ÄúVideo as the New Language for Real-World Decision Making‚Äù. Google believes Both text and video data are abundant on the internet and support large-scale self-supervised learning through next token or frame prediction. However, they have not been equally leveraged: language models have had significant real-world impact, whereas video generation has remained largely limited to media entertainment. Yet video data captures important information about the physical world that is difficult to express in language. To address this gap, the study discusses an under-appreciated opportunity to extend video generation to solve tasks in the real world. The authors observe how, akin to language, video can serve as a unified interface that can absorb internet knowledge and represent diverse tasks. Moreover, the researchers demonstrate how, like language models, video generation can serve as planners, agents, compute engines, and environment simulators through techniques such as in-context learning, planning and reinforcement learning. The study identifies major impact opportunities in domains such as robotics, self-driving, and science, supported by recent work that demonstrates how such advanced capabilities in video generation are plausibly within reach. Lastly, the research identifies key challenges in video generation that mitigate progress. Addressing these challenges will enable video generation models to demonstrate unique value alongside language models in a wider array of AI applications.

16.	***Long-Context Language Modeling with Parallel Context Encoding:*** <br>
Princeton introduces Context Expansion with Parallel Encoding (CEPE), a framework to extend large language models' context window. CEPE efficiently processes long inputs, offering improved performance in language modeling, in-context learning, and retrieval-augmented applications.<br><br>
26 Feb, Princeton Uni published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16617.pdf) ‚ÄúLong-Context Language Modeling with Parallel Context Encoding‚Äù. The authors point out that extending large language models (LLMs) to process longer inputs is crucial for numerous applications. However, the considerable computational cost of transformers, coupled with limited generalization of positional encoding, restricts the size of their context window. The researchers introduce Context Expansion with Parallel Encoding (CEPE), a framework that can be applied to any existing decoder-only LLMs to extend their context window. CEPE adopts a small encoder to process long inputs chunk by chunk and enables the frozen decoder to leverage additional contexts via cross-attention. CEPE is efficient, generalizable, and versatile: trained with 8K-token documents, CEPE extends the context window of LLAMA-2 to 128K tokens, offering 10x the throughput with only 1/6 of the memory. CEPE yields strong performance on language modeling and in-context learning. CEPE also excels in retrieval-augmented applications, while existing long-context models degenerate with retrieved contexts. The paper further introduces a CEPE variant that can extend the context window of instruction-tuned models with only unlabeled data, and showcase its effectiveness on LLAMA-2-CHAT, leading to a strong instruction-following model that can leverage very long context on downstream tasks.

18.	***Latent Multi-Hop Reasoning in LLMs:*** <br>
Researchers investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit latent multi-hop reasoning. The study finds evidence of latent multi-hop reasoning pathways in LLMs, with context-dependent utilization and varying effectiveness across different types of prompts.<br><br>
26 Feb, Google, UCL, TAU published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16837.pdf) ‚ÄúDo Large Language Models Latently Perform Multi-Hop Reasoning?‚Äù. The authors study whether Large Language Models (LLMs) latently perform multi-hop reasoning with complex prompts such as "The mother of the singer of 'Superstition' is". The study looks for evidence of a latent reasoning pathway where an LLM (1) latently identifies "the singer of 'Superstition'" as Stevie Wonder, the bridge entity, and (2) uses its knowledge of Stevie Wonder's mother to complete the prompt. The research analyzes these two hops individually and considers their co-occurrence as indicative of latent multi-hop reasoning. For the first hop, the authors test if changing the prompt to indirectly mention the bridge entity instead of any other entity increases the LLM's internal recall of the bridge entity. For the second hop, the researchers test if increasing this recall causes the LLM to better utilize what it knows about the bridge entity. The study finds strong evidence of latent multi-hop reasoning for the prompts of certain relation types, with the reasoning pathway used in more than 80% of the prompts. However, the utilization is highly contextual, varying across different types of prompts. Also, on average, the evidence for the second hop and the full multi-hop traversal is rather moderate and only substantial for the first hop. Moreover, the study finds a clear scaling trend with increasing model size for the first hop of reasoning but not for the second hop. Experimental findings suggest potential challenges and opportunities for future development and applications of LLMs.

19.	***StructLM: Building Generalist Models for Structured Knowledge Grounding:*** <br>
University of Waterloo introduces StructLM, a series of models designed to enhance structured knowledge grounding capabilities in large language models (LLMs). The models demonstrate superior performance on various tasks, emphasizing the need for innovative design in handling structured data.<br><br>
Feb 26, Uni of Waterloo and other published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16671.pdf) ‚ÄúStructLM: Towards Building Generalist Models for Structured Knowledge Grounding‚Äù. The authors point out that structured data sources, such as tables, graphs, and databases, are ubiquitous knowledge sources. Despite the demonstrated capabilities of large language models (LLMs) on plain text, their proficiency in interpreting and utilizing structured data remains limited. The investigation of the authors reveals a notable deficiency in LLMs' ability to process structured data, e.g., ChatGPT lags behind state-of-the-art (SoTA) model by an average of 35%. To augment the Structured Knowledge Grounding (SKG) capabilities in LLMs, the authors have developed a comprehensive instruction tuning dataset comprising 1.1 million examples. Utilizing this dataset, the researchers train a series of models, referred to as StructLM, based on the Code-LLaMA architecture, ranging from 7B to 34B parameters. The StructLM series surpasses task-specific models on 14 out of 18 evaluated datasets and establishes new SoTA achievements on 7 SKG tasks. Furthermore, StructLM demonstrates exceptional generalization across 6 novel SKG tasks. Contrary to expectations, the authors observe that scaling model size offers marginal benefits, with StructLM-34B showing only slight improvements over StructLM-7B. This suggests that structured knowledge grounding is still a challenging task and requires more innovative design to push to a new level.

20.	***Alphabet's Market Value Drop Over Gemini Controversy:*** <br>
Alphabet, Google's parent company, experiences a $90 billion loss in market value due to controversies surrounding its generative AI product, Gemini. Concerns include racially inaccurate depictions and the chatbot's refusal to distinguish between negative historical figures.<br><br>
26 Feb, [according to Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/02/26/googles-gemini-headaches-spur-90-billion-selloff/?sh=319b004372e4), Google parent Alphabet lost some $90 billion in market value Monday as controversy over the Silicon Valley giant‚Äôs generative artificial intelligence product made its way to Wall Street. Shares of Alphabet fell 4.5% to $138.75 Monday, closing at its lowest price since Jan. 5 and registering its second-steepest daily loss of the last year. The selloff followed a spate of controversy surrounding Google‚Äôs Gemini AI service, with issues including Gemini‚Äôs image-generating service producing racially inaccurate depictions of historical figures and its chatbot refusing to determine the more negatively impactful historical figure between Adolf Hitler and Elon Musk, culminating in the company‚Äôs admission it ‚Äúmissed the mark‚Äù with Gemini‚Äôs early rollout and taking its AI image service offline for the next few weeks. ‚ÄúThe issue for the stock is not the debate [over Gemini] itself, it is the perception of truth behind the brand,‚Äù Melius Research analysts Ben Reitzes and Nick Monroe wrote in a Monday note to clients. ‚ÄúRegardless of your view, if Google is seen as an unreliable source for AI to a portion of the population, that isn‚Äôt good for business,‚Äù the analysts continued.

21.	***Genie: Generative Interactive Environments:*** <br>
Google introduces Genie, a generative interactive environment trained from unlabelled internet videos. Genie can generate action-controllable virtual worlds based on textual prompts, synthetic images, photographs, and sketches, providing a foundation for training generalist agents.<br><br>
23 Feb, Google published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15391.pdf) ‚ÄúGenie: Generative Interactive Environments‚Äù. In the paper, the authors introduce Genie, the first generative interactive environment trained in an unsupervised manner from unlabelled Internet videos. The model can be prompted to generate an endless variety of action-controllable virtual worlds described through text, synthetic images, photographs, and even sketches. At 11B parameters, Genie can be considered a foundation world model. It is comprised of a spatiotemporal video tokenizer, an autoregressive dynamics model, and a simple and scalable latent action model. Genie enables users to act in the generated environments on a frame-by-frame basis despite training without any ground-truth action labels or other domain-specific requirements typically found in the world model literature. Further the resulting learned latent action space facilitates training agents to imitate behaviors from unseen videos, opening the path for training generalist agents of the future.
